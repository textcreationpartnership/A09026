            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ To the courteous Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader; Thou haſt here the fruit of my ſickneſſe, whereby in the beginning of this Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I was made vnſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable for my publique duety. In this while, conſidering that Time is preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the dayes euill, as the Apoſtle ſaith, the Lord put into my heart, to redeeme the time: Whereupon (as God enabled me to hold vp my head) I looked ouer my ragged Notes, and ſcattered pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. Part of which, after my rude ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner polliſhed, are here offered vnto thee. I am not without hope, but that (by the good hand of God) as I had experience of the profit of theſe things, being deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by liuely voyce: ſo alſo the charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reading of them may much auayle
<pb facs="tcp:3294:5"/>thee. I know that euery day there are many new Bookes ſet forth, and of this kind not a few: yet in this method, with ſound &amp; briefe Propoſitions of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall points of Diuinity: euident and infallible proofes: ſuccinct and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous Explications; and plaine and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Applications, I haue not obſerued any: So that, this, and alſo the great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the multitude conſidred, I doubt not but the Indifferent, will free theſe my Endeuors from the cenſure of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, &amp; of writing Iliads (as they ſay) after <hi>Homer.</hi> I confeſſe ingenuouſly that much of my Explications is drawn fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fountains of other men, both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Writers, and many our owne worthy Countreymen. So that, as the little Bee, greatly induſtrious, flieth ouer many a garden and flower, to gather a little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: ſo haue I out of many mens gardens, ſelected and gathered many ſuch choice things, which I iudged might moſt make for thy benefit. And this can be no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb facs="tcp:3294:5"/>to mee, in aſmuch as the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned know, that (not to ſpeake of ſome of the Pen-men of the holy Ghoſt) both aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient &amp; later Writers, haue, to the great benefit of the Church, taken this courſe: &amp; alſo becauſe I haue made ſuch things, which I haue receiued from others, ſo to ſerue my purpoſe, either by contraction, addition, expoſition, or marſhalling into my order: that I may in ſome ſort iuſtly challenge them as mine owne.</p>
            <p>The ſumme of this my ſmall Labour, (to the which is prefixed an exhortation to the ſtudy of the Word) is an Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Deſcription of God, named the <hi>Grounds of Diuinitie,</hi> expounded &amp; applied, becauſe it propoundeth, preueth, and as a key openeth, &amp; eaſily vnlocketh, the hidden myſtery and counſell of God, concerning our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Ieſus Chriſt. The Queſtions and Anſwers, are fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and friendly depending. The Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, plaine, &amp; for the moſt part, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, pointing at ſome things in a word,
<pb facs="tcp:3294:6"/>at ſome in a parentheſis, which to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Reader wil be the more aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageable: and for the Vſes (which being practiſed, are the praiſe &amp; life of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) I haue not obſerued euery thing, nor ſo preſſed any thing, but that I leaue much more to be gathered and obſerued, by ſuch which are accuſtomed to Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. In a word, that which I iudged moſt profitable, I haue performed for thee.</p>
            <p>If thou beeſt learned, as thou needeſt it not, ſo I humbly intreate thee to know that I writ it not for thee yet I barre thee not the reading, but moſt willingly ſubmit it to thy cenſure. If thou blameſt the Phraſe and Stile, that it is not fluent and round, but ragged and harſh: Truly neither can I commend it. Happily, I haue ſtriuen, to be plaine, or at leaſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no skill in finer cookery, haue dreſt it as I was able, after our homely and country faſhion for the ſtomackes of the vnlearned, who relliſh and like better,
<pb facs="tcp:3294:6"/>of that which is plaine and eaſie, then either learned and deep treatiſes which they vnderſtand not, or ſuch cooked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits where the coſt is greater then the nouriſhment. Some delight in toyes like children: I ſhould then thinke very ill of my ſelfe, when I ſhould goe about to pleaſe their humour, fitter to be purged then noriſhed. Some (&amp; worthily) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their great acuity &amp; iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, like nothing (for themſelues) but that which tranſcendeth common capacities: I doe not thinke my ſelfe able to doe that which might giue them ſatisfaction. And, in aſmuch as there are three fold more which haue but meane knowledge, then which abound, it ſhall content me, that euen as Golde is common in Rich mens pockets, but Siluer is currant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the common ſort; it ſhall (I ſay) content me, if, while thoſe of deeper iudgement bee conuerſant in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the learned, my Labours may be in the hands of the meaner ſort, for
<pb facs="tcp:3294:7"/>whoſe ſake ſpecially I haue taken this paines.</p>
            <p>For thee therefore which arte but a beginner I haue laboured. If I may adde to thy knowledge and affection, and be a helper of thy Faith and Ioy; giue thou God the glory: I haue then attained the end of my labors: Reade once, and reade againe; it may bee the ſecond reading wil be more ſauory then the firſt. If thou profiteſt herein, according as I haue prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thee, I know thou ſhalt neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent thee. And thus, deſiring the helpe of thy prayers, I commend thee to God, and to the word of his Grace, wiſhing thy farther vp-building in all ſauing knowledge, godlineſſe, and eſtabliſhed comfort of conſcience, through Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

            <head>A SHORT AND PLAINE EXHORTATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON <hi>TO THE STVDY OF</hi> THE WORD, WITH SEVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall directions for the hearing and reading of the ſame, very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for theſe times.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the Sun is to the World, ſo is the Word of God to his Church and People, the light of their liues, the life of their ſoules: But as the Sunne in regard of the commonneſſe, is not duly conſidered; ſo the commonneſſe and plenty of the word (a benefite vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable) breedes the contempt of it. Euen as the <hi>Manna</hi> at the firſt admired, was afterwards loathed: ſo doth our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption vſe the word. When the Lord ſtrooke <hi>Aegypt</hi> with darkneſſe, then they vnderſtood the benefite of the light; ſo if the Lord ſhould deale with vs, ſending
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3294:13"/>ſuch a famine of the word, as the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> ſpeaketh of,<note place="margin">Amos 8.11</note> we would then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the plenty of the Goſpel to be a happy bleſſing: For we are brought to the acknowledging of good things, rather by the wanting, then the hauing of them. So the ſicke man learneth greatly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that health, for the which before his ſickeneſſe he was ſeldome thankefull; but this is of corruption: and grace muſt teach vs neuer the leſſe to eſteeme of the word for the plenty of it, and our liberty in profeſſing it; but ſo much the more to loue it, and for it to praiſe our mercifull God in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This alſo we muſt know, that the more plentifully the <hi>Lord</hi> giueth the means, the more fearefull is our blindnes, &amp; the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer we are to iudgement, if we make not good vſe of it. When <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched repentance, and the kingdome of God,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.10.</note> he ſaith: <hi>Now is the axe laid, &amp;c.</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid: Howſoeuer God hath hitherto ſpared, yet when the Sonne from his fathers boſome ſhall teach, Hee that heareth not now, ſhall bee hewen downe, and caſt into the fire. How cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable this way our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation is, is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3294:13"/>too too manifeſt, and what we haue cauſe to expect for it, I tremble to write.</p>
            <p>Wherefore as in the morning when the Sunne ariſeth in his ſtrength, we open our doores and windowes to partake of his comfortable brightneſſe: ſo, in as much as the Lord cauſeth the beames of his glorious Goſpell to ſhine clearely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, it is our parts to open our eyes, and to endeauour to be illuſtrated by the ſame. Is it not the Commandement,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.39 Coloſſ. 3.16.</note> binding all, and to all induſtry in the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and ſtudy thereof?</p>
            <p>That all are bound, may appeare by theſe reaſons: Firſt, if any might be diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with, for not ſtudying in the word; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in regard of the worthineſſe of their perſon, or for the multitude of their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, then Kings: but not Kings,<note place="margin">Deut. 17.18.19.</note> and <hi>Dauid</hi> is an example; therefore none. Secondly, all parents and children are bound to the knowledge of the word: but all degrees,<note place="margin">Deut. 6.7.</note> orders, and conditions of men, are in theſe contained: therefore all. Thirdly, the reaſon of the commandement ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it: <hi>In them you hope to haue eternall life.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 5.39.</note> But all hope for, and would haue eternall life: <hi>ergo.</hi> Fourthly, the Scriptures ſet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3294:14"/>downe the duties of all men in their ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall callings: but theſe duties we cannot performe, vnleſſe wee know them; and know them we cannot without the word. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Fiftly, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> writeth thus:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.15.</note> 
               <hi>Bee ready alwayes to giue an anſwere to euery man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you.</hi> But render a reaſon, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily we cannot, without the word: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all, whether teachers or learners, able or not able to read, are bound to the ſtudy of the word. Away then with the figge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaues of the multitude, who think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues here of diſcharged, either for their worldly buſineſſe, or becauſe they are not booke-learned, or for ſome ſuch fooliſh excuſe. This alſo reproueth the Papiſts, who barre the common people the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Scriptures; fearing leaſt that thereby they ſhould proue Heretickes: But this is a fooliſh feare; for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth the contrary; affirming, that the law maketh not wiſe men ſimple, but ſimple men wiſe; not putting out the eyes of them that ſee,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.7.8.</note> but giuing light to the eyes. And indeed, their reaſon is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon: for the word is a rule; but the rule maketh not the worke wrong, but is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3294:14"/>a meanes to right the ſame. The word is a light; but the light cauſeth not darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but the abſence of the light: So the word cauſeth not hereſies, but the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the word: yea, and if they well conſider, they ſhall finde, that not the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple common people, but the learnedeſt Clearkes, priding themſelues in their wit, haue beene the brochers of hereſies.</p>
            <p>As all are bound, ſo to vſe all induſtry and diligence to know the word: which is expreſſed in thoſe ſignificant tearmes &amp; phraſes: <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> and, <hi>let the word of Chriſt dwell in you plenteouſly: Search,</hi> that is, not ſlightly &amp; ouerly, as many do, not regarding whether they finde or no: but narrowly, &amp; painfully, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth, by <hi>calling, crying,</hi> and <hi>ſeeking,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 2.3.4.</note> as for ſiluer, and ſearching, as for treaſures: Then ſhall we vnderſtand the ſeare of the Lord, and finde the knowledge of God. <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you:</hi> that is, euen as they that dwell with vs vnder the ſame roofe, are well knowne vnto vs, and wee familiarly conuerſe with them: So ought the word to bee, not as a ſtranger; but as a welcome and wel-knowne gueſt: <hi>Let it dwell plenteouſly,</hi> or <hi>richly:</hi> that is,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3294:15"/>euen as cuery corner of a rich mans houſe is fraughted with ſtuffe, ſo ought we to be full-filled with diuine knowledge: This condemneth thoſe blinde ones, who liue like bruit beaſts, that haue no vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; whoſe brutiſh ignorance cannot be but exceeding fearefull: For euen as a houſe without walles and windowes, and other neceſſary furniture is accounted forlorne; ſo that is a very forlorne and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked conſcience, which is deſtitute of the knowledge of the word: And as it is an eaſie matter to leade the blinde out of the way; ſo the ignorant are eaſily lead, and taken in the ſnares of the Diuell. And this reproueth the negligence of ſuch, who are not carefull to apply themſelues with all diligence to the ſtudy of the word: our negligence herein being the cauſe of the barrenneſſe of knowledge in theſe plentifull times. If men would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow that time in the ſtudy of the word, which they for the moſt part beſtow, ſome in hunting and hawking, ſome in dicing and carding; ſome in drinking, ſwilling, and following bad company, ſome in ſloth and idleneſſe, thus wiſely redeeming the time, then certainely knowledge would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3294:15"/>among vs, as the waters that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the ſea. Euen as in matters of the world, though a man haue neuer ſo good a Trade; yet without labour and diligence he can doe no good in it: and as the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſhall beare rule,<note place="margin">Pro. 12.24. Pro. 22.29.</note> and ſtand before Kings, ſo knowledge ſhall increaſe to the diligent, when the negligent ſhall be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>There are two principall cauſes among many, which ought to prouoke our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence herein. The Difficulty, and the Vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Scriptures: The Scriptures are difficult and hard, but firſt not to all; but to them which periſh,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.3. 1. Cor. 2.14.</note> and to them which are naturall, and haue not the ſpirit: but to them which haue receiued the enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſpirit, it is otherwiſe: God, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the light to ſhine out of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſhining into their hearts, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them the light of the knowledge of God, in the face of Ieſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.6.</note> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are difficult, but not alwayes, the Lord more and more ſcattering the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the mindes of his elect Children, by his holy ſpirit. Thirdly, they are diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, but not all: for in the foundation of the doctrine of ſaluation, and of faith and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3294:16"/>manners, they are eaſie and plaine: but ſome places indeed are wonderfully hard: There is milke for babes: that is eaſie, and meate for ſtrong men,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.12.13.14.</note> there is hardneſſe. The Ancients of this haue excellently ſpoken: One ſaith, The Scriptures are like a mighty riuer, in the which a Lambe may walke ſafely, and yet an Elephant be drowned. And another: The writers of holy Scripture are in ſome things like An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, deſcending to the capacity of the ſimpleſt; and in ſome things as Angels, tranſcending the capacity of the learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. And againe, In the holy Scriptures ſome things are open, and ſome things obſcure: thoſe are for our nouriſhment, theſe for our exerciſe: by thoſe our hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is ſtaied, in theſe our loathing. And indeed, this variety addeth to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Scriptures, as in the globe of the earth, ſome land, and ſome ſea, makes both the more eſteemed; and in the land, ſome hilles, and ſome vallies makes both the more delightſome; and as the Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is ſo much the more welcome, after a hard and ſtormy Winter: euen ſo this mixture in the word, maketh both the more pleaſing, and continueth the edge
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3294:16"/>of our deſire to ſtudy: which if it were all alike, would ſoone be dulled.</p>
            <p>Theſe reaſons may be rendred why the Lord would haue ſome things in his word to be thus folded vp in the clouds of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity; making (as it were) darkneſſe their pauillion: Firſt, that we might know, and acknowledge the vnderſtanding of the word to be the gift of God. Secondly, to tame the pride and arrogancy of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which would ſoone appeare, if all things were obuious and eaſie at the firſt ſight. Thirdly, that we ſhould not vilipend and make light reckoning of the word: for this is our corruption: Proffered kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or grace is not eſteemed. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that impure dogges, and ſwine may be kept from holy thing. Fifthly, that wee ſhould make high account of the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the word, ordained for the opening and interpreting of the ſame. Sixthly, to ſtirre vs vp to prayer, and to continuall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and paines in the hearing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it: As matters of great difficulty, are not compaſſed (we ſee) with ordinary paines.</p>
            <p>Many by reaſon of the difficulty of the diuine Oracles, doe quite giue ouer the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3294:17"/>ſtudy of them; like vnto the ſluggard, or idle perſon,<note place="margin">Prou. 26.13.</note> who ſaith; <hi>A Lyon is in the way.</hi> But as generous and noble ſpirits are not daunted nor diſmayed by the dangers of great Enterpriſes, but rather ſo much the more inflamed with courage to ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: Euen ſo the difficulty of holy Scriptures ſhould not abate our paines; but in reaſon ſo much the more whet on our diligence: without the which, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no excellent, but no ordinary comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table meaſure of knowledge can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued. Is the word difficult? Then it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of thee ſo much the more induſtry in reading, hearing, conference, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and prayer; In which things if we did exerciſe our ſelues in a conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle manner, wee ſhould ſoone become men of ripe age in theſe hidden myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon to excite our paines, is the vtility and profite that comes by the word. As <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid of <hi>Goliath</hi> his ſword, <hi>There is none to that:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 21.9.</note> So I may ſay of this reaſon, <hi>There is none to this:</hi> For amongſt men, whoſe heart is ſo hard but profite and gaine will perſwade him?<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16.</note> But the Scriptures are profitable: <hi>By them we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3294:17"/>By them wee are conuerted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 17.20. Rom. 10.14. Pſal. 19.7. 2. Tim. 3.15. 1. Pet. 1.23. Iam. 1.18. Act. 10.44. Iam. 1.21. Luk. 11.28. Ioh. 6.68. Act 13.26. Pſal. 119.105. Pro. 6.23.

               <hi>and made wiſe: By them wee are regenerated. By the preaching of them wee receiue the Holy Ghoſt. By them wee are ſaued,</hi> therefore called, <hi>The words of eternall life, and of ſaluation.</hi> The word is compared to <hi>Light,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten vs. To <hi>Raine, Snow,</hi> and <hi>Dew</hi> to make vs fruitfull in good workes. To a <hi>Sword</hi> to defend vs. It is a <hi>Key,</hi> to direct vs to Chriſt, the treaſury of all happineſſe. It is as <hi>Sincere Milke</hi> to feede vs, and make vs growe: As <hi>Flagons of Wine,</hi> and <hi>Apples of Paradiſe</hi> to comfort vs. As <hi>Salt,</hi> to ſeaſon, purge, cleanſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue vs. Preferred before <hi>Honey</hi> for ſweetneſſe, before tryed <hi>Siluer</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> for price, and ineſtimable value. What ſhall I ſay? The praiſe and excellency of the Scriptures, exceedeth all the praiſe and commendation that can be giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. If I had the tongue of Angels, I could not expreſſe it, but muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ſay, as the Apoſtle in another place: <hi>O the deepeneſſe of the riches of the wiſedome of God, and of his word!</hi> Is any thing then ſo profitable as this? O what a baſe, ſlauiſh and fooliſh nature haue we, which runne and hunt after the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3294:18"/>of the world, neglecting the true &amp; certaine treaſures of the word. <hi>You haue a ſure word of the Prophets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19.</note> 
               <hi>to the which you do well if you take heed, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, if we ſtudy in the word, we haue the Angels fellow-ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, ſearching, enquiring, and deſiring to behold the things that are reuealed to vs by the preaching of the Goſpell.<note place="margin">1.

Secondly, from the certaine euent &amp; accompliſhing of the diuers propheſies, which neither by naturall cauſes, nor by the wit of man, could euer haue been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told. Thirdly, from the miracles which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than neuer could bring to paſſe. Fourthly, from the matter of them, containing the whole, pure and perfect law of God; and deſcribing ſuch a meanes of ſaluation, which both agreeth to the glory and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Iuſtice of God, and ſatisfieth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Fifthly, from the maieſty of them, which ſhineth euen through the humility and ſimplicity of the phraſe. Sixthly, from the inuincible firmity and continuance of them, notwithſtanding the rage of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſecutors, labouring to aboliſh their very memory. Seuenthly, from the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull harmony, and admirable conſent of all the parts of the doctrine contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein. Eighthly, from the force of them in the mindes of men, effecting, mouing, conuerting and transforming
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3294:20"/>vs into new men, and kindling a liuely conſolation in our mindes in the day of tryall, as appeared in the Martyrs. Ninth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the irreconcileable hatred of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and his complicies, tyrants, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and all prophane men, againſt the Scriptures, more then any other Bookes. Tenthly, from the vengeance of God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the contemners, blaſphemers and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the word. It were almoſt infinite to reckon all that might be ſaid herein: all which are good, iointly and ſeuerally conſidered, to confirme vnto vs the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scriptures, and to conuince the conſciences of all them, which in the vanity and wickedneſſe of their hearts, ſhall any way call them into queſtion.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it appeareth (and nothing can be ſaid to the contrary) that all are bound with all diligence, to ſtudy in the word of God.</p>
            <p>Two principall parts of our ſtudy in the word, are the Reading, and the Hearing of it. All then muſt giue all diligence to heare and read the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And becauſe things good in themſelues, through bad and negligent vſage, become oft-times vnprofitable and hurtfull vnto
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3294:20"/>vs, therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth and exhorteth,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1.10 Coloſ. 3.16</note> that <hi>the Word dwell in vs in all wiſedome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That wee ought wiſely to heare the word preached, appeareth by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelfe in his monitions to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Diſciples:<note place="margin">Mat. 15.10 Mark. 4.24 Luke 8.18.</note> 
               <hi>Heare and vnderſtand. Take heed what you heare. Take heed how you heare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vnto this wiſe hearing, three things are neceſſary: Firſt, ſomething is to bee done before we heare. Secondly, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the hearing. Thirdly, ſomething when we haue heard.</p>
            <p>That which is to be done before wee heare, is called <hi>Preparation;</hi> which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the auoiding of ſome things, and in the doing of other ſome.</p>
            <p>Thoſe things which are to be auoided, may be reduced to theſe fiue heads: The firſt is <hi>Intemperance:</hi> in riotous eating and drinking, &amp; pampering the body; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are made vnfit for the exerciſes of the word: the body being then more apt to ſleepe then to heare. Full bellies (for the moſt part) haue empty ſoules; and therefore our Sauiour Chriſt moniſhed his Apoſtles to <hi>beware of ſurfeiting and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3294:21"/>drunkenneſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 21.34</note> 
               <hi>which oppreſſe the heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is <hi>Diſtracting cares of the world:</hi> theſe muſt be baniſhed out of our minds when we come to heare the word: As <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he went to ſacrifice his ſonne vpon the mount,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.5.</note> left his Aſſe and Seruants at the foote of the hill: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo, when we come to the holy hill of God with the Congregation, we muſt put off, and abandon all our owne thoughts, words and ſeruile labours: For as thornes choke the Corne, ſo will theſe the word, as our Sauiour teacheth.<note place="margin">Luk. 8.14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The third is <hi>Preiudice</hi> againſt the perſon of the Teacher: for when the perſon is once diſtaſted, we reliſh not his doctrine, though neuer ſo good. So <hi>Ahab</hi> could not abide <hi>Micaiah;</hi> and therefore would not endure his teaching and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>The fourth is <hi>Pride</hi> for ſome meaſure of knowledge receiued: As many will ſay, they know as much as the Preacher can tell them. It may be they doe: But doe they practiſe it? Such muſt know; firſt, that preaching is not onely to teach men that which they know not, but alſo to ſtirre them vp to practiſe that which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3294:21"/>they know: not ſo much ordained to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the iudgement, as to reforme the affection. Secondly, they muſt remember that part of the ſong of the Virgin: <hi>He fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the hungry with good things; but the rich he ſendeth empty away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth is <hi>Carnall ſecurity:</hi> when we come to the hearing of the word with a reſolution, that ſpeake the Lord what he will; and cry the ſeruants of God againſt our ſinnes, as long and as loud as they will, yet we will do as we liſt. For many by this meanes come into the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the vncleane beaſts into the Arke; they come in vncleane, and goe out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane. Well,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.28 2. Theſ. 2.10.11.</note> this of all other is moſt fearefull, and the high way to a reprobate minde.</p>
            <p>Theſe eſpecially, and ſo all other ſinnes muſt be carefully auoided, and vnfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repented of:<note place="margin">Wiſd. 1.4.</note> 
               <hi>For wiſedome entreth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a defiled ſoule.</hi> And as the eye, if it be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill affected, cannot diſcerne the obiect; ſo the minde infected, and the conſcience polluted with theſe and the like ſinnes, cannot poſſibly vnderſtand the things of God: Sathan by theſe meanes ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of our hearts the pretious ſeed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3294:22"/>of the good word of God.</p>
            <p>Thoſe things which are to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before the hearing of the word, are eſpecially two. The firſt is prayer. If wee muſt pray before the receiuing of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily meate, much more before this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly food of our ſoules. And in our prayers wee muſt commend our Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and our ſelues vnto the Lord. For our Teachers we are to pray for three things: Firſt, that their lippes may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue knowledge. Secondly, that they may be faithfull in deliuering the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of God vnto vs. And thirdly, that they may powerfully and wiſely ſpeake to our conſciences.</p>
            <p>For our ſelues alſo we are to pray for three things: Firſt, for the pardon of our ſinnes. Secondly, that our mindes may be opened to vnderſtand. Thirdly, that our hearts and affections may be ſanctified to obey the holy word. For oftentimes we do not that we know to be beſt; but that vnto which our affections carry vs. An ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and a good heart is a notable ſigne of Gods Spirit.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be done, is timely and ſeaſonable reſorting, with the reſt of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3294:22"/>Gods people, to the houſe of God. Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent comming, that is when we come one ſtragling after another; howſoeuer it be ordinary almoſt in all places, yet it argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a groſſe careleſneſſe and neglect, if not contempt of the worſhip of God. If our loue vnto the word ſhould be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hereby, it would ſoone appeare to bee a great deale leſſe then our loue to Faires, Markets, Feaſts and merry-meetings, as they call them, vnto the which we will be ſure to come with the firſt. O that wee had but halfe the care to come to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket and feaſt of our ſoules, which is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the word! Why ſhould we not bee like to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> in ſtriuing to out-run one another to the houſe of God,<note place="margin">Iohn. 20.4.</note> as they to the Sepulchre of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>In the time of <hi>Nehemias</hi> the people ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered all together,<note place="margin">Nehem. 8.1.</note> and called for the reading of the Law:<note place="margin">Act. 10.33</note> And <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his houſhold were all ready waiting for <hi>Peter,</hi> to heare the word.<note place="margin">Luk. 5.1.</note> And the people preſſed vpon Chriſt to heare him. The forwardneſſe of theſe is for our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>In hearing, three things are requiſite: firſt, Attention; ſecond, Intention; third,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3294:23"/>Retention: The 1. ordereth the body, the 2. the vnderſtanding, the third the memory: Attention is, when the whole body, but ſpecially the eare, and the eie are reuerently compoſed to heare the word.<note place="margin">Eccle. 4.17</note> Of the eare we reade, <hi>Be more neere to heare.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 4.28</note> Of the eye, <hi>The eies of all that were in the Synagogue were faſtned on him,</hi> that is, on Chriſt, when he began to teach them. Of the reuerent carriage of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great may be an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who as <hi>Euſebius</hi> reports, though he were the moſt noble Emperour that yet the world hath ſeene, for the moſt part would ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d at the preaching of the word, and not ſit downe, though admoniſhed of his Nobles.<note place="margin">Luk. 10.39</note> 
               <hi>Marie</hi> alſo is an example hereof. Wherefore, to ſleepe, to talke, to reade, to gaze vp and down in euery cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which is the marke of a foole, as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> teacheth, are ſpecially to be auoyded. So alſo departing out of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without iuſt and reaſonable cauſe; as the people ſtayed for <hi>Zacharie,</hi> though in regard of the viſion hee held them very long: Euen ſo ſhould we ſtay with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, till the Congregation be diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the bleſſing of God.<note place="margin">Luke 1.21.</note> More reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3294:23"/>then muſt bee of a great many pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in hearing. If <hi>Paul</hi> will haue wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men reuerently to behaue themſelues in the congregation, becauſe of the Angels; much more ought all, both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, behaue themſelues reuerently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the preſence of God, who is the Lord both of men and Angells: of the which his preſence we haue his promiſe: and therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> called the meeting the ſaints in his time the preſence of God.<note place="margin">Mat. 18.20.</note> As therfore <hi>Iacob</hi> was ſtricken with great reuerence for the viſion which hee had at <hi>Bethel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 42.2.</note> &amp; ſaid, <hi>How feareful is this place?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 28.17</note> 
               <hi>this is none other but the houſe of God, this is the gate of heauen:</hi> ſo ſhould wee eſteeme of the aſſemblies of the children of GOD, worſhipping in feare, as <hi>Dauid;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 1.7.</note> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring we are preſent before God himſelf, as <hi>Cornelius.</hi> The ſecond is Intention, and this is of the mind, when wee diligently marke thoſe things which are taught. For if our thoughts wander,<note place="margin">Acts 10.33</note> and bee not bent on the things ſpoken, we heare without profite. Euen as wee ſee by experience, that in a deep meditation, though our eies be fixed vpon ſome certaine obiect, yet we ſmally regard it: ſo, if the minde bee not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3294:24"/>preſent aſwel as the body, all is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, For this is to be like the Iewes, who honoured God with their lippes, but their hearts were farre from him. Wherefore heere is required, that wee ſuffer not our hearts to wander, but that we call home all the powers of body and ſoule to this holy buſineſſe; not onely marking ſome words, and ſentences, but the Booke, the Text, the Parts, the Doctrines, the Proofs, and the Vſes. This is Intention, and this is commaunded to the Church:<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.10</note> 
               <hi>Heare O daughter, and conſider, incline, &amp;c.</hi> And, <hi>Cauſe thine care to hearken,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 2.2.</note> 
               <hi>and incline thine heart to wiſedome and vnderſtanding.</hi> The third is Retention, and this is of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; when we lay vp the word of God in the heart, as the virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings concerning Chriſt:<note place="margin">Luke 2.51.</note> Not ſo to lay it vp, as the euill ſeruant the talent, neuer to vſe it; but as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in the yeares of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, laied vp corne for reliefe againſt the yeares of famine; ſo ſhould wee ſtore vp the word, that wee may haue it ready for our vſe vpon all occaſions offered. And this is noted to bee the property of good ground;<note place="margin">Luke 8.15. Ioh. 14.23.</note> 
               <hi>To keepe the word.</hi> But many are like to ſiues, or broken veſſels, into which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3294:24"/>whatſoeuer is poured, is loſt. That bodie thriueth not, where the ſtomacke wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a retentiue faculty to keepe the meat till it be digeſted: Euen ſo, all the hearing in the world profiteth not, if wee be not carefull to remember it. Wherefore, as a man hauing receiued a pretious iewel ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth it not at his heeles, but layeth it vp charily vnder locke and key: ſo ſhould wee lay vp the word which wee haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. The word is a well of life; but (as <hi>Iacobs</hi> well) it is very deepe: Preaching is the drawing of this water; our hearing the fetching of it: But as wee goe not to the riuer for water to ſpill it by the way; ſo if we ſpill and looſe the word wee haue receiued, what profite ſhall wee haue? And becauſe we are nimble to apprehend, and ſtrong to retaine euill things; but ſlow, and weake to good things; we muſt earneſtly pray and entreate the Lord, to ſanctifie, and to ſtrengthen our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that that which we haue once heard, we may often remember, to the benefite of our ſoules; <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which is to be done after we haue heard, is <hi>Meditation,</hi> the very life of our Hearing and Reading; and it is a reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3294:25"/>in our mindes, and a repeating againe thoſe things which wee heare and read: without the which, I dare bee bold to ſay, that neuer any did, or ſhall profite in the ſtudy of the Word: This meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is either with God or man: Meditation with God, is either when we giue thanks, or pray, concerning things heard or read. When thou haſt heard, praiſe God for it, and pray that by the finger of his Spirit it may be written in thy heart: and that thou maiſt finde in thy ſelfe, the liuely formes of the doctrines deliuered: It is a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of profiting by the Word, when we can conclude the things we heare and reade in the forme of a prayer.</p>
            <p>Meditation with Man; is, either with our ſelues, or others.</p>
            <p>With our ſelues, when wee make triall what we can remember of that wee heare and reade: and heere wee muſt not ſtay, but proceed to the heart and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and examine them vpon euery point wee haue heard. As if thou haſt heard that which before thou kneweſt not: bleſſe God, and labour to bee more confirmed in the truth. If any thing hath bene reproued, that either thou art guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3294:25"/>or not guilty: If guilty, bleſſe God that thou art admoniſhed of thy fault, and from hence make thy riſe to repentance: If thou beeſt not guilty, praiſe God, for preſeruing thee from ſuch ſinnes, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in his word: If thou haſt heard a vertue, or good duety commended, then either thou haſt not practiſed it, or thou haſt: If nor, beginne heere in the name of God; if thou haſt, praiſe God for ſuch grace, and let ſuch exhortations encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thee to proceed in wel-doing.</p>
            <p>Meditations with others; is, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with our family, or with any other of the godly brethren, we do reuerently and diſcreetly conferre of the things deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The benefite heereof muſt needs be great; for as two eyes ſee more then one; ſo when wee meete to conferre of that which we haue heard, that which one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth, another may remember; and that which is not well vnderſtood by one; is, it may bee, better marked by another.<note place="margin">Luk. 24.31.</note> The two Diſciples thus coferring, had their vnderſtanding opened: And the men of <hi>Berea</hi> their faith confirmed:<note place="margin">Act. 17.11.12.</note> And this is wiſely to heare: The Lord bleſſe al his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with this grace for Chriſts ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:3294:26"/>
Thus much concerning wiſedome in hearing the Word: Now followeth to be declared, how wee ſhould read the holy Scriptures wiſely.</p>
            <p>That we are wiſely to reade, teacheth our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.15.</note> 
               <hi>Let him that readeth conſider:</hi> and wee finde by other experience, that our affaires vndertaken raſhly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due conſideration, ſucceed not.</p>
            <p>That we may reade wiſely, three things are neceſſary: 1. <hi>Reuerence:</hi> 2. <hi>Order:</hi> 3. <hi>Iudgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Reuerence</hi> is required in our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the holy Scriptures; both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Maieſty of the Authour of them, which is the liuing God; and alſo in regard of the worthineſſe, and weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the contents, and matter of them: which is the hidden, and great myſtery of godlineſſe, concerning Ieſus Chriſt, and eternall life: The ſumme of the word of the Lord, is, <hi>The word, the Lord:</hi> In theſe two reſpects, beſides many other, the Scriptures are farre more excellent then all other writings whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>Therefore when thou takeſt thy Bible, remember the Lord whoſe word it is; and ſanctifie thy exerciſe therein, with a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3294:26"/>and deuout prayer, for leaue; and for an vnderſtanding heart: yea, as <hi>Moſes</hi> at the ſetting forward of the Arke, and at the reſting of it deuoutly prayed.<note place="margin">Numb. 10.35.36.</note> So whenſoeuer thou readeſt, begin and end; open and ſhut thy booke with prayer: For as they which come to the Lords Table, and eate and drinke vnworthily, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently, eate and drinke their owne iudgement, not conſidering the Lords Body.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.29.</note> So they which come irreuerently to the reading of the Scriptures, as to the reading of any prophane or common booke, reade to their owne iudgement for not conſidering the Lords Booke. As we reade that the Lord commanded <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to put off his ſhooes, when hee drew neare the burning Buſh;<note place="margin">Exod. 3.5.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe the ground whereon hee ſtoode was holy ground.</hi> So when wee drawne neare to the Lord, in offering to reade his word; hee commaundeth vs to put on holy and reuerent affections, becauſe the Booke wee reade, is a holie Booke. For, which way ſoeuer we turne or caſt our eies: in euery leafe and page thereof, the holy and reuerent name of the Lord is engrauen. As <hi>Peter</hi> therefore writeth of ſpeaking, <hi>If any man ſpeake, let
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3294:27"/>him talke as the word of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.11</note> ſo may I ſay; if any reade, let him reade, as the words of God. For as many thouſands of the <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhemites</hi> were ſore puniſhed for their irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent gazing vpon the Arke:<note place="margin">1. Sa. 6.19.</note> as we reade alſo of <hi>Vzzah:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ch. 13.10</note> So verily, the iuſt Lord ſtriketh many Readers with blindnes and hardnes of heart, for irreuerent vſage of his holy Scriptures. When thou readeſt therefore, be reuerent, and pray. Pray; for this is the way to obtaine wiſedome:<note place="margin">Iames 1.5. Luke 11.13</note> and to obtaine the Spirite: which ſpirit, leadeth in to the knowledge and practiſe of all trueth:<note place="margin">Iohn 18.13</note> and which reuealeth vnto vs the hidden things of God:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.10</note> Vſe reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence alſo: <hi>For the feare of God is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of wiſedome:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 1.7.</note> And the ſecret of the Lord is reuealed to them which fear him; and his couenant to giue them vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: The Lord put in our hearts this feare for Chriſts ſake,<note place="margin">Pſa. 25.14.</note> 
               <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing required in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the word is Order; and Methode; which is a great furtherance of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and a ſingular helpe of memorie. An army diſranked in and out of battell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray neuer getreth the victory: ſo neither doth diſorderly and confuſed reading, get
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3294:27"/>any great meaſure of grounded know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>As Saint <hi>Luke</hi> wrote the Goſpel in an orderly manner from point to point:<note place="margin">Luke 1.3.</note> ſo wee are to reade the word, in an orderly manner going forward from point to point. Memorable is the example of one <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> a King of <hi>Spaine;</hi> who; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the affaires of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, read ouer the Bible foureteene times in order, with certaine Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries vpon the ſame: As his diligence is here very commendable, and for our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; ſo alſo this: He read in order. If therefore I were worthy to giue directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons this way, I would thus aduiſe: Firſt, what booke ſoeuer we take to read, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the beginning, and ſo to continue reading till we come to the end of it. And thus ſhall wee carry the ſumme and the drift of the Hiſtory and argument before vs; of which in a great part, they which read now a Chapter in one booke, now a leaſe in another, muſt needs be ignorant. Such ſimple readers I may liken to thoſe ſimple women, which are alwayes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but are neuer able to come to any ſound knowledge of the truth.<note place="margin">2. Tim 3.7</note> For as he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3294:28"/>that goeth but an eaſie pace in the right way, ſpeedeth his iourney faſter then he that maketh more haſte in a wrong way: Euen ſo a little read in good order, aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageth the knowledge more then greater paines, if it bee confuſed. Secondly, I would aduiſe, that in our reading we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne firſt with the eaſieſt and playneſt Bookes, as the hiſtory of Chriſt, ſet down by the Euangeliſts, and the Booke of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis:</hi> Then to reade the Epiſtles, firſt the ſhorteſt, as the Epiſtles to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians, Coloſsians,</hi> the firſt and ſecond to the <hi>Theſſalonians:</hi> then the Epiſtles to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> and to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which laſt Epiſtle is called of ſome, the Key of the Bible. And when wee haue tryed our ſelues in theſe, then to beginne the Bible, and to reade it through: For euen as in Trades there are ſome things more eaſie, to the which the apprentice is applied; and afterwards, as hee groweth in capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hee is taught the harder and more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret things of his myſtery: ſo in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, there are ſome things eaſie and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar for learners, and beginners, as milk for babes: and there are other things, hard and obſcure, which it is not ſafe to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3294:28"/>meddle withall, till wee haue our ſenſes well exerciſed in the word.</p>
            <p>The third thing required in wiſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, is Iudgement and Diſcretion; by the which, firſt wee make choice of a fit time to reade: ſecondly, diſcerne the right ſenſe and meaning of that wee reade; and thirdly, apply and make the right vſe of our reading.</p>
            <p>Iudgement is requiſite;<note place="margin">Pſal. 112.5</note> for a wiſe man miniſtreth all his affaires with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and euery thing is beautifull in his time.<note place="margin">Eccle. 3.10.</note> Therefore the time is ſpecially to be regarded. All time is not to bee ſpent this way. For our callings muſt carefully be followed: neither is all the time to be taken vp in our callings, but ſome time is to be ſpared for reading, prayer, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation: One of theſe may not hinder an other, which muſt needs come to paſſe without Iudgement. <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> obſerued prayer thrice a day; and they that feare God, will ſo diuide their times, that at the leaſt once a day they will reade a chapter or two in the Bible; and becauſe of the ſtuggiſhneſſe of our nature, ſoone weary of good things: it were good to taske our ſelues; and when it ſo fals out
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3294:29"/>that we are conſtrayned vpon extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary occaſion, to leaue our taske vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performed one day, then to double our paines and diligence the next time, riſing the earlier, and working the harder in our callings, that we may redeeme that time without any loſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the ſecond Emperour of that name, is reported to haue written out the Bookes of the New Teſtament with his owne hand, accounting it a ſpeciall Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well; and out of it hee read euery day, praying with his wife and ſiſters, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Pſalmes. And it was that famous Eunuches practiſe, as we may gather out of the eight chapter of the <hi>Acts.</hi> I reade of another Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> who was wont to account that day loſt, in the which he had not beſtowed a benefit vpon ſome of his ſubiects: So we may well reckon that day among our loſſes, in the which wee reade not, or meditate not of ſomething in the word. But fooliſh men thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect; I haue no leiſure, by reaſon of vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency and multitude of buſines. To ſuch a one I anſwer: Is any buſineſſe more vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent then this? <hi>Martha</hi> is troubled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede about many things; but this one
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3294:29"/>thing is neceſſary: namely, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God by his word. Againe, Thou wilt ſpare a time to eate and ſleepe, why not then to read? <hi>Iob</hi> eſteemed the words of God, more then his appointed food: If our loue were ſuch to the word,<note place="margin">Iob. 23.12.</note> wee would rather ſpare the times of our ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, then of our reading; as <hi>Iacob</hi> ſpared the meate out of his belly to buy the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Hath the body neede of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hath not the ſoule much more?<note place="margin">Gen. 25.30 &amp;c.</note> Now the bread of the ſoule is the word of God. O Lord giue vs euermore of this bread, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Iudgement alſo is requiſite in reading, that wee may vnderſtand the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt: For the word of God is not in the letters and leaues, but in the meaning and ſence, as ſome of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents haue ſpoken; yea, one of them ſaith: that the word of God fooliſhly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, is not the word of God. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt hauing oftentimes to deale with the learned Scribes and Phariſies,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.3. &amp; 19.14. &amp; 21.16.42. &amp; 22.31. Mark. 12 24.</note> and with the Sadduces, asketh thus: <hi>Haue you not read?</hi> and, <hi>Did you neuer read?</hi> and <hi>You erre, not knowing the Scriptures.</hi> And yet theſe Scribes did ſo diligently reade
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3294:30"/>the Scriptures, that they numbred the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and words: but they read without iudgement; not diſcerning, nor ſearching into the heart of the ſence, but ſtaying in the barke of the letter. Thus to read is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. And here, as we muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to finde the meaning, that we may not read as children; ſo alſo we muſt take heed, that we feigne not a meaning of our owne, and thruſt it vpon the word; leſt we proue Heretickes. Therfore the right, true, and fit ſence is to bee ſought out: which of one place can be but one: And that muſt be, not according as we thinke; (for no Scripture is of priuate interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.20</note>) but according to the Scriptures, which are the onely beſt expounders of themſelues. The meanes, and ready way to finde out the genuine and true meaning of any Scripture, are eſpecially theſe: Firſt, a due and learned conſidering of the originall Tongue, in the which the Scripture is written. Secondly, a diligent marking of that which goeth before, and that which followeth. Thirdly, a wiſe comparing together, the place in hand, with other places, both like and vnlike. Fourthly, a heedfull examining of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3294:30"/>ſence ariſing, with the Analogy of faith; that is, with the doctrine contained in the Apoſtles Creed, ſo called, the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the ten Commandements, which are a ſhort ſumme of the whole Bible. Fifthly, conference with the learned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters. Sixthly feruent prayer to God for vnderſtanding: for as wee cannot ſee the Sunne without his owne light; ſo we cannot ſee the wonders of the word, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Lord manifeſt them vnto vs by his Spirit.</p>
            <p>The third thing that is to be done, that wee may read in iudgement, is <hi>Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to make vſe of that wee attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by reading, in the reforming of our liues. Many eſteeme highly of the tree of knowledge, with <hi>Eue;</hi> but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not the tree of life: when as the very life of our knowledge conſiſteth in the practiſe of that which we know. As it is ſaid of Hearers, ſo it is true of Readers. <hi>Not the readers of the word,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 13.17. Iam. 4.17.</note> 
               <hi>but the doers ſhall be iuſtified.</hi> And, <hi>Theſe things if you know them, happy are you of you doe them.</hi> Nay, he that knoweth, and doth not, ſhall bee the more beaten, and is guilty of the more ſin. As therefore wiſe men labour to make
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3294:31"/>profite of all things they deale with: ſo we ſhould propound this end to our ſelues in all our reading, that it may be profitable to teach, to improue, to correct, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct vs in all righteouſneſſe, that we may become abſolute and perfect in all good workes. Some read onely to this end, that they may know more then they did; and this is vanity: Some that they may bee knowne to know more; and this is pride: Some to make a gaine of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and this is filthy lucre: Some to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie others; and this is charity: Some to edifie themſelues, and this is Chriſtian prudence: ſuch like words hath one of the Antients. Another ſaith thus: Then is our reading to be commended, when we turne the words into workes. And againe, the Scriptures are Gods Epiſtle written to men, to the end they ſhould liue well: And the Holy Ghoſt better then all;<note place="margin">Reuel. 1.3.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that readeth, and they that heare the words of this propheſie, and keepe thoſe things which are written therein. Amen. Now to God onely wiſe, be honour and praiſe for euermore.</hi>

               <hi>Expl.</hi> The Scriptures are two waies taken, eſſentially for the doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them; and accidentally for the writings wherein ſuch Doctrine is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: now in both theſe they are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, but Canonicall properly the firſt way. The whole Scripture is the rule, but not the whole of the Scripture: as in a Carpenters Rule, euery thing that is of the Rule, is not the Rule.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures are Diuine and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, becauſe God is the Author, who can neither be deceiued, nor deceiue by word,

And of this authority they are in themſelues, though all the world ſhould contradict it, or be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it: As the ſunne was the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the day &amp; night, before either man or beaſt were made to behold it.

Pet. 1.21 1. Cor. 2.13</note> the firſt is their owne voyce, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing that they are of God; as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this is repeated in the Prophets, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> And this is the chiefeſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, euen the very voice of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3294:37"/>of which we may ſafely collect thus: If the Scriptures be true, when they ſpeake of things to come; then alſo when they ſpeake of things preſent. The ſecond argument is like vnto the firſt, and it is the teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt; which as it inſpired the holy men to write, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it teacheth the children of God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue the Scriptures:<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.21 1. Cor. 2.10</note> for if faith be the gift of God, as it is, then alſo to beléeue the Scriptures to be the word of God. The firſt of theſe is to perſwade others and our ſelues: the other chiefly to ſatiſfie our our ſelues: which alſo is alwaies agréea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Scriptures, and is to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſame. Vnto theſe two you may adde alſo, their miraculous preſeruation, notwithſtanding the rage of all <hi>Iulians,</hi> and Diuels: the diuine vocation, miſſion and life of the Writers, the Maieſty of the ſtile, the purity of the Doctrine, their power vpon the conſcience, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding and breaking of the ſtubborne, and for the raiſing, conuerting, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting of the broken, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> This ſerues to confute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papiſts, who hold, that the only &amp; chiefe argument whereby we are perſwaded of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authority
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3294:38"/>of the Scriptures, is the teſtimony of the Church: we willingly acknowledge, that the Church is a meanes whereby wee come to the knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scriptures; but not that for the which only we beléeue them to be diuine. The Scriptures are a Rule,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.15.</note> the office of the Church is to keep &amp; to vſe this Rule. Now as the worke-man which vſeth a Rule, giues not that power to it, wherby it iudgeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dimenſions, but it hath it of its owne nature, by an inward eſſentiall property as it is a Rule: ſo alſo the Scriptures haue not this power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, though the Church haue power &amp; ſkill to vſe the ſame. And therfore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour when queſtion was whether he were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Meſſiah</hi> or no, reſteth not on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Iohn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 5.36 Ibid. Verſ. 37. Verſe 39.</note> but vpon greater and better witneſſe, &amp; this witneſſe was, <hi>his workes, the witneſſe of his Father, and of the holy Scriptures.</hi> So when the <hi>Teſſalonians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the preaching of <hi>Paul</hi> as the word of God,<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 2.13.</note> it was not the teſtimony of any Church, nor the worthineſſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> a meane &amp; poore man, but the very force of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word it ſelfe, which bowed their hearts. The teſtimony of the Church is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced, &amp; is good, but not infallible. The
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3294:38"/>teſtimony of the Scriptures themſelues is better, and infallible. The Church is to be proued by the Scriptures, not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures only by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church. Yea, the Papiſts to proue the infallibility of the Church, flie to the Scriptures. And vniuerſally,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.18 1. Tim. 3.15.</note> the authority prouing, is greater, more certaine, &amp; more knowne then the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion proued by the ſame. Yea, if we ſhould belieue the Scriptures onely for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, which is in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the Pope &amp; his Prelates: then firſt, they ſhould be Iudges in their own cauſe, which is vnequall. Secondly, there could be no certainty of Faith or Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church hath varied diuerſly in her iudgement of the Canon. Thirdly, why may not the <hi>Turkes</hi> perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that their teſtimony of their Alcoran is as ſufficient as ours of the Scriptures. Fourthly, this is to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the Word of God to the will of Man: yea, God to man: ſo that God ſhall not be beleeued to ſpeake to vs, nor we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him when he ſpeaks, vnleſſe it pleaſe the Church; that is, the Pope and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates: yea, there ſhal be no more difference betweene God &amp; the Diuel, truth &amp; lying,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3294:39"/>the ſacred and diuine Scriptures, and the Alcoran of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> then the Church ſhall thinke fit, which is moſt horrible blaſphemy: The Lord open the eies of our Aduerſaries (the Papiſts) to conſider it.</p>

               <hi>Q. <hi>How do theſe holy Scriptures ſet forth and deſcribe God? or what do you beleeue God to be according to the Scriptures?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. <hi>I beleeue by the Scriptures, that God is a Spirit, being of himſelfe, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing being to all things, Infinite, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, Almighty, Knowing all things, &amp;c. Wiſedome, Goodneſſe, Mercy, Truth, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice it ſelfe, &amp;c.

            <p>
               <hi>Expl.</hi> None muſt imagine, that I haue ſet downe all that can be ſaid of God, for there are many other particulars in the holy Scriptures; but theſe are the heads: neither can the knowledge of Men &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels expreſſe fully the amplitude of his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and glory. Though that ſo much as is auaileable for vs to know, himſelfe hath reuealed in his word: for it is moſt true, that a learned man ſaid:<note place="margin">Ramus.</note> God cannot be defined without his owne logicke: This
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3294:39"/>is not a Definition, but a Deſcription, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Scriptures, conſiſting of thrée parts, firſt of Attributes: ſecondly, of Relations and proprieties of perſons: Thirdly, of Actions and Effects, which are generall, as Creation &amp; Prouidence: ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, belonging only to his Church, which are principally two, Redemption, and Sanctification. Of theſe I purpoſe (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as God enableth) to enquire in order, according to the Scriptures: and firſt, I will briefly expound the Atributes as they are alleaged.</p>
            <p>We beleeue that God is a Spirit.<note place="margin">Ioh. 4.24.</note> Now this word <hi>Spirit</hi> is taken many wayes, but when it is attributed to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, it is either eſſentially taken, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally: here not perſonally, for ſo it is onely attributed to the third perſon; but eſſentially, and ſo the meaning is, that God is moſt ſimple, without compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, merely incorporeall, neither to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by any bodily ſence,<note place="margin">Luk. 24.39</note> according as you read that Chriſt diſtinguiſheth.</p>
            <p>That God is of himſelfe,<note place="margin">Exo. 3.14. Rom. 11.36.</note> &amp; giueth being to all things, is proued. And this of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attributes beſt ſetteth forth what God is, &amp; is moſt peculiar to him, ſignified
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3294:40"/>by the name <hi>Iehouah,</hi> which principally betokeneth two things: firſt, the Eternity and alwaies being of God: ſecondly, his cauſe of being to all other things, ſpecially his promiſes: and therefore was it that God told <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he was not knowne to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> by his name <hi>Iehouah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 6.3.</note> becauſe the promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was not performed vnto them: Hence alſo it is, that vſually in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, when either ſome ſpeciall mercy is promiſed, or ſome extraordinary iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned, the name of <hi>Iehouah</hi> is affixed; which is a name incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable vnto any creature, and ineffable: not in reſpect of the letters (as thought the <hi>Iewes</hi>) but of that which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſignified, the Nature and Eſſence of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Infinite,</hi> is that which can neither be comprehended by any creature, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, nor circumſcribed in any ſpace, or bounds, but being whole and the ſame euery where, filleth Heauen and Earth, not onely with his vertue and operation,<note place="margin">1. King. 8.27. Ier. 23.24.</note> but with the greatneſſe of his Eſſence. And thus is God infinite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eternall,</hi> is that which neither hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3294:40"/>nor end of his Being:<note place="margin">Pſal. 90.2.</note> and ſuch is God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Almighty,</hi> is that which without any difficulty or labour, onely by his will, can effect and bring to paſſe all things, which hée willeth, or which in his Nature,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.1. Pſal. 115.3 Mat. 19.26</note> or Maieſty, hée can will, and that in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant: And ſo we beléeue of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Omniſcience,</hi> or to know all things, when wée attribute to God; is meant, that God doth alwaies moſt perfectly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and in a wonderfull manner, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to vs, ſée and behold himſelfe, and the whole order and purpoſe of his minde, reuealed in the nature of things, and in his Word: and whatſoeuer agréeth, or diſagréeth there with; and all the works, words, and thoughts of all men, and all creatures, paſt, preſent, and to come,<note place="margin">Pſ. 147.5. Rom. 11.33 Heb. 4.13.</note> with all the cauſes and circumſtances of all things: and this is proued.</p>
            <p>For the reſt of the Attributes, as <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Goodneſſe, Mercy,</hi> &amp;c. they néed no Expoſition: Onely this is to bee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that wée beléeue, not onely, that God is <hi>Mercifull, Wiſe, True,</hi> &amp;c. but <hi>Mercy, Wiſedome, Truth,</hi> becauſe they are his Eſſence, and Being; euen euery one of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3294:41"/>them, being his whole Eſſence. In the Creatures theſe are Accidents, that is Qualities, which may bee changed, loſt, increaſed, or diminiſhed: but not ſo in the Creator, for nothing is Accidentall in him, but Eſſentiall: and therefore by ſuch forme of ſpéech is ſignified that God in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the ſame, like himſelfe; Vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, either in regard of time, or the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the creature: As, in the creature the perſon, which hath life and wiſedome, is one thing, and the wiſedome and life in the creature another thing: but in God they are not diſtinct from his Eſſence, but his Life and Wiſedome are his Eſſence, and cannot bee changed in him as in the creature:<note place="margin">Numb. 23.19.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3294:44"/>the Heretickes not ſo: but one in conſent and will, &amp;c. And therefore the Church, out of the common &amp; vſuall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking, vpon this neceſſitie; bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed certaine tearmes to defeat the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes: which tearmes it hath taken, not as though theſe or any other, could fully expreſſe this myſtery, but, that it might not wholy be concealed: of the which an Emperour ſpake well and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly;<note place="margin">Gratian to Ambr.</note> We ſpeake of theſe things, not as we ought, but as we can.</p>
            <p>Neither doth the Church vſe theſe tearmes <hi>Eſſence, Perſon,</hi> in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and vſuall meaning wholly; as namely: The Eſſence of man, is a thing communicable; but it is an vniuerſall Name, which truely exſiſteth not by it ſelfe, but is onely a collection of the minde, and therein conceiued. But <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence Diuine</hi> as it is communicable, ſo alſo it truely is and ſubſiſteth, and is not an imaginary thing as the former; nor an vniuerſall name, as the Philoſophers ſpeake of the humane Eſſence; but the <hi>Diuine nature,</hi> ſubſiſting indéede, being common to the thrée Perſons, and whole in euery one.

Firſt, the Diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture common to the thrée Perſons, truly ſubſiſteth, ſo doth not the humane. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The thrée Diuine Perſons differ not in ſubſtance; but the thrée humane Perſons doe ſubſtantially differ, ſo that one whole, is wholy diſtinct from an other. Thirdly, In the humane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, there is a difference betwéene them, in time: as one yonger then another. In dignity; one more worthy then another: In will; one contradicteth another: In works one laboureth more then another, but there is none of theſe things in the Diuine Perſons: Fourthly, In humane Perſons it followeth not,<note place="margin">Iohn 14.10</note> where one is, that there the other ſhould be; <hi>Paul</hi> is at <hi>Rome, Peter</hi> at <hi>Antioch:</hi> but in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine it is otherwiſe;<note place="margin">Iohn 8.29.</note> where one is, there are all, for their common and vndiuided Eſſence.

And Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> caueat is ſingular, If thou canſt not find what God is, yet take heede to thinke of God that which he is not. This doctrine of the true God, one in Eſſence, three in Perſons, is moſt religiouſly to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, kept, profeſſed, maintained, and taught in the Church, both for the glorie of the True God, and alſo to diſtinguiſh vs from Iewes, Turkes, and Infidells; and for our owne comfort and ſaluation,<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3294:46"/>that it is ſpoken excluſiuely, not in regard of the other Perſons, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Idoles, and the Creatures. The Father is the firſt perſon, the Sonne the ſecond, the Holy-ghoſt the third: not in time and dignity, but in order: all equall in all attributes and workes, though in regard of vs, Creation be attributed to the Father, Redemption to the Sonne, and Sanctification to the Holie-ghoſt, without excluding the other perſons: for one &amp; the ſame God doth all theſe things, according to a common ſaying; <hi>The workes of the Trinitie out of it ſelfe are vndiuided.</hi> So theſe perſons are two wayes diſtinguiſhed, firſt by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon outward operations, which with a common efficacie they worke in, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the creatures; ſauing alwayes this order of the perſons, that the Father worketh of himſelfe by the Sonne and the Holy-ghoſt; the Sonne and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-ghoſt, not of themſelues, but by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Secondly, they are diſtinguiſhed by perſonall proprieties, and inward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which they haue towardes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. The proprietie of the Father to beget, and to be of none. The propriety
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3294:47"/>of the Sonne, to be begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The propriety of the Holy-ghoſt, to proceed from the Father and the Son. Where we muſt obſerue, that wee may not ſay the Godhead begetteth, or is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, or proceedeth; but the perſon. The Sonne and the Holy-ghoſt being of themſelues, as they are God: of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as perſons: The eſſence of the Son and Holy-ghoſt wanting beginning: their perſons hauing the Father for their beginning from euerlaſting. For the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Deitie is to be diſtinguiſhed from the maner of ſubſiſting in the ſame.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall deſire to know what is the meaning of the generation of the Sonne, and proceeding of the Holy-ghoſt, and how they differ: let this ſuffice to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; that by generation and proceeding, is meant a receiuing of an Eſſence from another: yet with two cautions. Firſt, that we conceiue no ſuperiority or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, betweene that which giueth and that which receiueth. Secondly, that we thinke of no priority or poſteriority in time or dignity betweene that which is begotten, and that which proceedeth. And for the diſtinguiſhing of theſe, I know
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3294:47"/>no other Art but this, that the Sonne is begotten and proceeds not, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-ghoſt proceedes, and is not begotten: For that which is not written, is not to be ſpoken or thought. There is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene them, but I am not able to vnfold it, faith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both the generation of the Sonne, and the proceſſion of the Holy-ghoſt are ineffable. And yet the ſame S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> goeth thus farre, ſaying, that that which is begotten, proceedeth, but that which proceedeth, is not begotten: The firſt part of which ſpeach, being vnderſtood of the inward workes (as they are called) of the Deity, I dare not auow; becauſe theſe are ſpeciall proprieties of perſons, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting no ſuch communication. To conclude this whole point, let vs heare <hi>Nazianzene,</hi> who being preſſed of one, to ſhew the difference betweene proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and being begotten. Doe thou tel me (ſaith <hi>Nazianzene</hi>) what is Generation, and I will tell thee what is Proceſſion, that we may both runne madde, in ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching into the vnreuealed ſecrets of God.</p>

The abſence of theſe, is vnderſtoode by thoſe words, <hi>without forme and void:</hi> Yea, it had not the name of Earth: for that name it had the third day, here ſo called by anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was not onely empty and void, but drowned, as it were, in a moſt déepe gulfe of waters, and ſwimming in the ſame; being like vnto a ſlimy or muddie ſubſtance; not appearing, vntill by the power of God it was compacted into a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide maſſe, and drawne out of the depth;

            <p>Firſt, to diuide the day and the night by their riſing and ſetting: the Sunne to rule the day, the Moone and Starres to gouerne the night.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they were ordained for ſignes, (I vnderſtand not in regard of their ſcituation, as to make the ſignes in and out of the Zodiaque) but in regard of their vſe, portending and ſignifying ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things by the diuine ordinance, which are neceſſary for the life of man. The ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the ſtarres (otherwiſe called Prognoſtication) by their riſing, ſetting, &amp;c. as by cauſes or ſignes, are three-fold: Firſt Naturall, as of the Eclipſes of the Sunne &amp; Moone, Earth-quakes, Winde, Raine, Drought, &amp;c. Secondly Ciuill, as the opportunity of many ciuill actions: as of fit time of Nauigation for Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, plowing and ſowing for Huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3294:57"/>hiring and letting of ground for houſholders, &amp;c. Thirdly Spirituall,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.</note> by their naturall and preternaturall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: as of changes in Common-wealths, Warres, &amp;c. which diuers times are by Ecclipſes, Blazing-ſtarres, &amp;c. fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhowne: Which though they haue, for the moſt part, &amp; cauſe in Nature; yet by the will and appointment of God, doe fore-ſignifie ſuch things, as Fore-runners of the wrath of God, as experience hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, as the ſignes in the aire which <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> mentioneth, immediately forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the horible ſignes foregoing the generall Iudgement.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3294:64"/>enioying peace, and confidence, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe before God: or a good troubled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; when, though we beléeue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, yet through ſome ſin that we haue committed, or through our in-bred infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, we are troubled and in doubt: and this is called Good; not becauſe it is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, but becauſe of the true grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is renewed, with the which true grace, may and is oftentimes, yea for the moſt part, and that in the beſt men and women, trouble ioyned: as <hi>Dauids heart fainting him,</hi> and <hi>Pauls</hi> crying out: <hi>O wretched man!</hi> Bad conſcience is that which is not renewed: for euery man till he bée in Chriſt, hath a bad conſcience: and this alſo, according to a two-fold e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate thereof, is either an euill quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whereof there are two degrées: firſt, a ſlumbring conſcience, that ſtirres not but when death comes, or in ſome grieuous affliction:<note place="margin">Gen. 42.21</note> as the brethren of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph.</hi> Secondly, a ſeared conſcience, which hath no more ſence and féeling then a ſtone, no not in death, as may appeare by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> example of <hi>Nabal.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 25.37.</note> Or an euill trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled conſcience, which is two-fold: either a large conſcience, that makes no bones
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:3294:65"/>of ſmall ſinnes (as they are called) but ſtirres or ſtickes only at monſtrous ſins: as which trembles at murder, but makes nothing of anger, reuiling and reuenging, ſo it be not in bloud. Such is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience alſo, which refraines from bloudy oathes; but as for Faith &amp; Troth, Bread, Drinke, the light that ſhines, &amp;c. neuer féeles or checkes for them: or a narrow conſcience: and this is, when the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence féeles not greater ſinnes, and yet is very ſenſible of ſmall things, or trifles: as the Phariſaicall conſcience, making great conſcience of tithing Mint and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.24</note> but neglecting Mercy, Faith and Iudgement: or as the Popiſh conſcience, ſtreyning at a little fleſh on a Friday, but ſwallowing blaſphemies, whooredomes, and other grieuous ſinnes, without any trouble.</p>
            <p>That faculty of our ſoule, which take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth knowledge, and determineth of all our actions, is called Conſcience, either becauſe it is a partner with another in the knowledge of a ſecret (which Another is God) or becauſe it is ioyned with certaine Principles and Rules of the Law, in the minde, and with memory; vſing the helpe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3294:65"/>of theſe in the execution of the office ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>The office of Conſcience is two-fold: Firſt, to know all things in a man, or done, and omitted by man: all thoughts, words, déeds, affections, and the omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all duties: the ſoule by conſcience ſéeking it ſelfe, as by a reflection. As for inſtance: The Soule by ſcience kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth a thing; the Conſcience, it knowes that it knowes ſuch a thing. The Heart thinkes a thought, good or euill: by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience the heart knowes that it thinkes ſuch a thought. By Faith the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues: by Conſcience, the heart knowes it doth beléeue. By affectious the Soule grieues, or ioyes: by conſcience we know we do ſo.<note place="margin">Rom. 9.1.</note> And hence the conſcience is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Regiſter, or Notary.</p>
            <p>The ſecond office of conſcience is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of the thoughts, words &amp; deedes of men: which things as they are diuers, in regard of time, ſo is the action of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence diuers concerning them. The actions (to inſiſt onely of them) are either paſt, or to come: Of actions paſt, conſcience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth two wayes: according to double conſideration, or queſtion, of ſuch
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3294:66"/>actions. As firſt, whether they were done or not done: ſecondly, whether they were well or euilly done.</p>
            <p>For the firſt queſtion, whether an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were done or no, Conſcience within moſt certainly certifieth: As in <hi>Caine,</hi> when his Tongue ſaid, <hi>I know not where my brother is,</hi> his Conſcience ſaid, Thou knoweſt wherere he is: for thou haſt kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him. So in <hi>Dauid,</hi> when he was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as a Traytor againſt <hi>Saul:</hi> his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſaid, that he was no Traytor, nor had conſpired againſt him. So in <hi>Iob,</hi> when his friends ſaid, he was an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite: his conſcience witneſſed within him before God, that he was none. And hence is conſcience called a witneſſe: yea, a thouſand witneſſes.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond queſtion, whether a thing be well or ill done: Conſcience, with the helpe of certaine Principles in the Minde, iudgeth in euill things, as a Witneſſe accuſing, and as a Iudge condemning: In things well done, as a Witneſſe excuſing, and as a Iudge acquiting: And both theſe, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Practicall Reaſoning, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.15.</note> Of euill things thus: In the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3294:66"/>example of <hi>Caine,</hi> Hee that killes his Brother ſinneth grieuouſly (ſaith the Principle in the minde.) But thou <hi>Caine</hi> haſt killed thy Brother, (ſaith Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as a Witneſſe by the helpe of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory) therefore thou haſt ſinned grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly, ſaith Conſcience an Accuſer. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, murtherers muſt be damned (ſaith the Principle of the minde) by the Law. But thou <hi>Caine</hi> art a murtherer (ſaith conſcience as an Accuſer:) therefore thou ſhalt be damned, ſaith Conſcience as a Iudge condemning. And from theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience come more or leſſe, feare, griefe, ſadneſſe, deſperation, &amp; other feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conſequents. Of good things thus: in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> example of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> or <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</hi> He that ſorroweth truly for ſin, &amp; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it, and followeth righteouſneſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth (ſaith the Principle, or Rule in the minde.) But thou <hi>M.</hi> or <hi>M. M.</hi> doſt ſo, (ſaith conſcience as a witneſſe,) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou repenteſt (ſaith conſcience excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing) Againe, he that repents ſhal be ſaued (ſaith the rule.) But thou <hi>M.</hi> or <hi>M. M.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteſt (ſaith co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience excuſing:) therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhalt be ſaued (ſaith conſcience acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) And hence come peace of conſcience,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3294:67"/>Ioy, boldneſſe to come into the preſence of God, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The actions to come, of which Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence determineth, are either good or had: The conſcience, in regard of her Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good actions, may be called aſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or prouoking conſcience: As thus, if the queſtion be concerning kéeping of the Sabaoth: the commaundement of God muſt be kept, ſaith the Rule; but to kéepe the Sabaoth is a commandement of God, ſaith the Iudgement of Reaſon, therefore kéepe the Sabaoth, ſaith Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. In regard of had things, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may be called a brideling, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining Conſcience: as, if queſtion be, whether the Sabaoth may bee broken: thus, The commandement of God may not be broken: but to breake the Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth is to breake the commandement of God, therefore breake it not ſaith conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Thus by experience we féele with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs, before we do a thing, a certaine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer puſhing vs backe, or egging vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: or we ſéeme to heare a voyce in our breaſts, bidding, or forbidding vs. And when we do contrary to the motion and moniſhing of conſcience, we are ſaid
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3294:67"/>to wound, and to ſin againſt our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which is grieuous. Now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how the Conſcience determineth of Actions: So alſo of Thoughts and Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 1.</hi> Looke well to thy conſcience, and examine it: for a good conſcience is not of Nature, but of Grace, by Faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note> through the bloud of Chriſt. For it is the bloud of <hi>Ieſus</hi> applied by Faith,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.14.</note> which purgeth the conſcience both from the guiltineſſe and filthineſſe thereof. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent not thy ſelfe then, though thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be quyet, and trouble thée not: for it may ſo be, and yet be ſtarke nought. Bee ſure that the quietneſſe thereof bee grounded on the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and the aſſurance of the pardon of thy ſinnes: Elſe when it ſtirreth and awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it will be like a Lyon, ready euen to rend out thy throat. Call therefore thy conſcience to her office here, which if ſhée diſcharge, and being rightly informed, excuſe thée, thou mayeſt truly haue bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe before God: Otherwiſe, euen as a man that hath the gout, is not healed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for a little time he féeleth it not beat and fret: ſo neither doth the quietneſſe of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3294:68"/>conſcience argue the health and goodneſſe thereof, vnleſſe it be quieted by the blood of Ieſus. Better thy conſcience accuſe here then in the day of Iudgement, when (though it ſléepe now) it will, vnleſſe it be preuented, moſt certainely accuſe and confound. For the nature of it is alwaies to take Gods part, though it be againſt it ſelfe. Make then thy concience thy friend againſt that day; when a good conſcience will be more woorth then a whole world: The remembrance of which time, made <hi>Paul</hi> endeuoure to haue a cleare conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before God and men.<note place="margin">Acts 24.16</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 2.</hi> If thou once getteſt a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, kéepe it with all diligence: For as a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt:<note place="margin">Prou. 4.23 Pro. 15.15. 2. Cor. 1.12</note> Yea, a very heauen vpon earth; ſo an euil and guilty conſcience is an vnſpeakeable torment, yea a very hell, for a wounded ſpirit who can beare? If a man haue a good conſcience,<note place="margin">Pro. 14.</note> he cannot want comfort in the middeſt of the fire: But if a man were in Paradiſe, as <hi>Adam,</hi> with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill conſcience, hee muſt néedes want comfort: for as the ſhadow followes the body, ſo doth an euill conſcience follow the vnrepentant ſinner, alwaies dogging
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3294:68"/>him; and crying fearefully againſt him. Thou haſt ſinned: thou ſhalt be damned: driuing into moſt fearefull agonies and paſſions, euen vnto finall deſperation, as in <hi>Iudas,</hi> if the mouth be not ſtopped by the merites of Chriſt. The Heathen thought, that thoſe who liued ill, were haunted with furies, and fiends: Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this is the fiend, euen thy euill conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience; gnawing vpon thy heart, and ſtinging as a Scorpion, neither canſt thou auoyde it, but onely by faith in Chriſt. Kéepe therefore thy good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (if thou haſt it) as the chiefeſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well: which thou ſhalt doe, if thou ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue theſe Rules. Firſt, cheriſh Faith: for it is the root of a good conſcience: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, auoyd all ſinne, for as a moat in the eye, ſo ſinne troubleth the peace of conſcience: and as water queucheth fire, ſo ſinne putteth out the goodneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And therefore when <hi>Abigaile</hi> would perſwade <hi>Dauid</hi> from bloody reuenge, ſhe vſeth an argument from preſeruing the peace of conſcience, and perſwadeth him: Thirdly, walke in the continuall practiſe of righteouſneſſe: which, that wée may be able to do, namely both to auoyde ſin,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.18</note> &amp; to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3294:69"/>liue honeſtly: A fourth thing muſt bee done, which is the right enforming of the conſcience, that it be able to diſcerne good from euil, and miſtake not one for an other: for as an vnſkilfull Pilote, that knoweth not the coaſt, eaſily maketh ſhippewracke: and as a bad guide ſoone bringeth into danger, ſo a conſcience not inſtructed in the truth. For if thou doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and doeſt doubtingly, thou ſinneſt: though the action be lawfull in it ſelfe, yet not to thée: <hi>for whatſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14.23</note> If thy conſcience erre, taking that to be good which is euill, thou canſt not but ſinne: for if thou doſt according to thy erring conſcience, thou ſinneſt in doing contrary to the commandement of God. If thou doeſt it not, thou ſinneſt alſo, becauſe thou doſt againſt conſcience, and there is no way to helpe out of theſe briers, but to enforme the conſcience in the truth; which is by the word of God, the rule of conſcience: by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that all ſuch which neglect the word of God,<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3294:69"/>thou couldſt conceale thy faults from al men, yea from the diuell, yet there is a bird in thy breaſt, which will tell tales, and bewray all: the conſcience is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand witneſſes; happy is he which hath it to witneſſe for him before God.</p>

               <hi>Expli.</hi> Herein conſiſts the chiefe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of man, to be like his Creator: for God made not man like other things made, but like himſelfe; like I ſay, hauing ſome ſparkes of excellency, as repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Diuine Nature; though this likeneſſe be ſuch that there remaines an vnſpeakeable diſtance betwéene God and man, euen in his greateſt perfection.</p>
            <p>Though the feature of the body bee moſt beautifull, yet herein we place no part of the Image of God: though wee confeſſe, that euen as the lanthorne is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3294:70"/>by the candle within it: euen ſo the body is made, in ſome ſort, reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by the brightneſſe of the Soule within, in which the Image of GOD chiefly reſideth. And yet to ſpeake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, we ſay not, that the Soule, but that the whole man was made according to Gods Image.</p>
            <p>This Image (not to ſay any thing, of the ſpirituall Eſſence, and Immortalitie of the Soule) was partly in the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on granted ouer the Creatures: which dominion was not direct: (for God is onely the ſoueraigne Lord;) but profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: conſiſting in his dwelling, and the vſe and benefit of the Creatures: yet the extent of this, onely to the inferiour cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures, as the earth, ſea, ayre, and the creatures liuing in the ſame. Partly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was the Image, in the excellent Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Knowledge, Holines, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and Trueth, wherewith man was endowed; ſo that as the former reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Gods imperious maieſty, ſo this his infinite purity and Holineſſe. And this alſo wée are to remember, that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was made aſwell as the man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Image of God: though in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3294:70"/>regard of the ſubiection of the woman to the man, it more excellently, in that,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.8.</note> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the man.</p>

               <hi>Expli.</hi> We néed not feare to attribute euill actions to the decrée of God, becauſe the Scripture ſo ſpeaketh; onely we muſt ſoberly and wiſely vnderſtand it: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Pharaohs</hi> cruelty, <hi>Sheme is</hi> cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <hi>Abſolons</hi> vncleannes, <hi>Iudas</hi> his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of Chriſt; are not by his reuealed wil approued, but forbidden: and yet that by his good pleaſure hee will permit the ſame. Which permiſſion we may not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to be the ceſſation of his care and prouidence, or an ydle wincking at the matter; but ioyned with an actiue power, not of infuſing euill into men: but firſt of taking away or denying his grace, and of deliuering of them moſt iuſtly to Satan, and to the luſts of their owne hearts. And alſo of bounding their wils, purpoſes, and actions, and directing them to a good end. For God is ſo good that he would neuer ſuffer euill to be, if hee could not bring good out of euill; Euen as the ſkilfull A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3294:72"/>knoweth how to vſe poyſon well, and to the good of the patient. And ſurely, this is amoſt pregnant proofe of the powerfull prouidence of God herein, when thoſe actions which are done by wicked men contrary to his will, yet are brought to ſerue and fulfill his holy will and purpoſe. For euen as in an Armie one fighteth for praiſe, an other for lucre of the ſpoyle, an other is egged forward by deſire of reuenge; yet all for the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and for their Prince: and as in a ſhippe, ſome weigh vp Ankers, others ſtand at the pumpe, others at the ſterne, and all by ſeuerall workes labour for the ſafety of the ſhip: ſo, whatſoeuer the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked propound to themſelues, yet the Lord ordreth all to his good pleaſure, will they, nill they: ſo that as an arrow flieth to the marke which the ſhooter aymeth at, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſence whither it goeth: So the Lord ſerueth himſelf by the wicked thogh they thinke not ſo much.<note place="margin">Eſay 10.5, 6, 7.</note> Hence is it that though the decrée of Gods prouidence (as hath béene ſaid) is concerning thoſe euill actions; yet neither is God guilty, nor man guiltleſſe, God is not guilty, becauſe he putteth no euill into men, but vſeth
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3294:73"/>them as he findeth them, and ſo maketh them to ſerue his glory, who may vſe what creatures he will, and cannot vſe them, though they be euill, but well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is infinitely good. Neither is man guiltleſſe, notwithſtanding the Decree: for ſinners are not excuſable, becauſe there is no force vſed towards them, but they follow their ſinnes with great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and a very willing minde, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting away the care of vertue, do, of their owne accord, yeeld themſelues to their owne luſts, reſpecting in their euill déeds onely the ſatiſfying of their owne wils, and not the fulfilling of the will of God. The Iewes did what the hand &amp; will of God had determined before to be done to CHRIST; but they conſidered not that, but were led vnto that ſinne by the malice and couetouſneſſe of their owne wicked and enuious hearts, which were the true cauſes thereof. So that, (as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) In one and the ſelfe ſame thing, GOD is iuſt, and Man is moſt vniuſt, becauſe in that one thing which they doe, there is not one cauſe for the which they do the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:3294:73"/>
Here further it is to be marked, that the Decrée of God (in reſpect whereof all things are neceſſary) doth not take away contingency; which is, when a thing, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is, had a cauſe whereby it might haue béene otherwiſe. As the bones of Chriſt muſt be vnbroken in regard of Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crée, and yet they might haue béene bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in regard of their owne nature, and the fréedome of the mindes of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Neither may any thinke, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are fruſtrated, deliberations, prudence and vſe of meanes: for as God decréeth the being of things, ſo alſo the meanes wherby ſuch things ſhall be. As in regard of Gods Decrée, <hi>Lot</hi> cannot be burut in <hi>Sodome;</hi> but then he muſt eſcape, and hie him away out of the Citty. <hi>Dauid</hi> muſt ouercome <hi>Goliath,</hi> but then he muſt take his Sling, with the ſmooth Stones, with him. <hi>Manaſſes</hi> muſt be ſaued, becauſe God hath ſo decréed, but then he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and beléeue, which are the meanes of ſaluation appointed and decréed by God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 1.</hi> Labour ſoundly to vnderſtand, and with all thy wit to maintaine this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: for to deny the Prouidence is all
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3294:74"/>one as to deny God:<note place="margin">Pſal. 14.1. Pſal. 10.4.11. Pſa. 14.1.2</note> and this indéede is a maine cauſe of the prophaneneſſe of vile men.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, denying a fatall deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, whereby all things, euen God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſhould be tied to the nature of ſecond cauſes, and abhorring all conceit of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and méere chaunce (which are words fitter for Heathens then Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which beléeue there is a GOD) let vs hold faſt this Doctrine, that all things whatſoeuer are gouerned by an Ocular Prouidence:<note place="margin">Pſal. 58.11 Heb. 11.6.</note> Yea, if any thing fall out, which wee might thinke to bee by chaunce, becauſe wee ſee not the cauſe of it, yet to be perſwaded that ſo it was fore-ſéene, and fore-appointed and decréed of GOD, as that place of <hi>Numbers 35.22.</hi> compared with that of <hi>Exodus 21.13.</hi> doth moſt plainely ſhew.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 2.</hi> This Doctrine alſo comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth many wayes: Firſt if wee (as we ought) carefully obſerue the experiences of Gods prouidence towards vs, in the often vnexpected ſucceſſe of our affaires, we muſt needes both be confirmed in our Faith, the more ſtedfaſtly to depend
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3294:74"/>and truſt on GOD, and alſo be hereby occaſioned often to giue thankes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if Affliction come, it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that it commeth not out of the duſt, but by the wiſe and iuſt appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of GOD; And this breedeth pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whereas the Church, and ſuch as feare GOD, haue many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, this teacheth that they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but as GOD pleaſeth: yea, the very Diuels themſelues can neither hurt <hi>Iob,</hi> nor enter into the Swine, but as they are licenced by GOD, and when he pleaſeth to licence either Sathan, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Men, or other Creatures, to hurt his Children, or Seruants, he both boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them, beyond which they cannot go, and alſo in the end turneth all things to the beſt.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, neglect not lawful meanes for the accompliſhing of thy lawfull deſires: for this were to tempt GOD: And yet truſt not in the meanes, though neuer ſo likely: for that were to ſacrifice to thy worth, and to commit a kinde of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry. Haſt thou Bread? Then that is a good meanes of Nouriſhing: But
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3294:75"/>God can breake the ſtaffe of it, and make it as a ſtone to thee: For man liueth not by bread onely, but by the word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe annexed thereto.<note place="margin">Deut. 8.3.</note> In the vſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of all meanes concerning either Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall or Spirituall things, looke vp vnto heauen, and pray for a bleſſing, or elſe thou watcheſt in vaine, thou laboureſt in vaine,<note place="margin">Pſ. 127.1.2.</note> in vaine thou vſeſt any meanes: yea, in the midſt of many difficulties, though thou then ſée no meanes, yet truſt in God,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.8.</note> for God will prouide, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſaid: Wherefore go on cheerefully in thy calling, ſeruing God, and caſting thy care vpon him,<note place="margin">Pſal. 55.22. 1. Pet. 5.7.</note> for hée careth for thée: Nay commit thy very Soule vnto him in wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, as vnto a moſt faithfull Creatour. For if God cloatheth the Graſſe,<note place="margin">1.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus much of the generall workes by which God is deſcribed: Creation, and Prouidence, which extend to all things. Now of the more Speciall, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Church, which are Redemption, Sanctification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt. <hi>You ſaid that God is the Redeemer of his Church: What is Redemption?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. <hi>Redemption is a worke of God, whereby hee hath fully deliuered his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, from ſinne, the curſe of the Law, Eternall Death, and the power of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Expl.</hi> The deliuery of Mankind from ſinne and death is, ſignificantly, by the Holy Ghoſt called Redemption: which ſignifieth, a purchaſing, or buying againe, or a Ranſoming at a price (as life for life) of them which are in bondage. Therefore is Chriſt called, a <hi>Price,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 20.28 1. Tim. 2.6. Act. 20.28.</note> a <hi>Counter-ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome:</hi> The Flocke of Chriſt is ſaid to bee purchaſed with Gods owne Bloud: and <hi>Yee are bought with a price.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>We were in bondage, euen to the very Diuell of hell, the great enemy of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3294:76"/>and therefore vngodly men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.26.</note> are ſaid to bee taken aliue, in the ſnare of the Deuill, at his will. Alſo wee were in bondage to ſinne, the curſe of the Law, and to eternall condemnation, from all which Chriſt hath deliuered vs,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.14. Gal. 3.13. Tit. 2.14.</note> by a Price, euen Himſelfe.</p>
            <p>But heere we muſt know that Chriſt ranſoming vs out of the clawes of the deuill, by a Price, paies not this Price to the deuill, but to God: who deliuers ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to the deuill, as to his executioner to bee tormented: And when this worke of Redemption is ſpoken onely, of taking vs from ſathan, it noteth that wée are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by power and force, not by a price: Therefore in the Goſpell, Chriſt in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Sathan, is called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Stronger, who ouer-commeth him and diuideth his ſpoiles.<note place="margin">Luk. 11.22. Col. 1.13.</note> Wée are ſaid to bée deliuered foin the power of darkneſſe; where the word ſignifieth by fine force, to deliuer or plucke away. Euen as <hi>Dauid</hi> pulled the Lambe out of the Beares mouth, ſo hath Chriſt by his Almighty power, reſkued vs out of the mouth of the Roaring Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: So alſo hée hath deſtroyed the deuill,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.14.</note> not by aboliſhing his ſubſtance, but by
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3294:76"/>weakening his power, as the word there importeth: Chriſt then payeth his Bloud as a price to his Father, and ſo, forcibly deliuereth vs from the deuill: Who hath the power of death, as the Hang-man hath the power of the Gallowes; not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, but by commiſſion from God, for the tormenting of the wicked.</p>
            <p>This Redemption wée ſpeake of, is ſo the worke of God, that wée exclude all creatures from any power, or poſſibility of redéeming vs.<note place="margin">Pſal. 49.7.</note> And wée acknowledge it to bée the worke of the whole Trinity deliuering vs in the perſon of the Sonne, who redéemeth vs by his Merite, and by his Efficacy: by his Merite, deſeruing Redemption for vs: by his Efficacy, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually applying it vnto vs by his Spirit through Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> Firſt, héere wée may ſée the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull miſery, in the which wée are all, till wée haue our part, in the Eternall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, purchaſed for vs by Ieſus Chriſt: For firſt, we are vnder the power of ſinne, and the tiranny of the deuill: ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bond-ſlaues; more miſerable then euer were the poore Iraelites in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or now are the poore Chriſtians vnder the <hi>Turke:</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:3294:77"/>for the bondage of theſe is onely bodily: ours more: bodily and ſpirituall alſo: our bodies and very Spirits being ſubiect to obey his filthy will in all things.<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, we are all our life time in feare of death; euen as is the caſe of one condemned to the Gallowes, hee alwaies trembles and quakes at the approach and remembrance of the houre of his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So wee, if God make vs ſenſible of our eſtate, in regard of ſinne, are alwaies haunted with the terrours of an euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as with Furies and Fiends of hel: as <hi>Caine, Saul, Iudas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thurdly, wee are fire-brands of hell, ſubiect to eternall condemnation, for our ſinnes, &amp;c. This is our miſery, which who ſo vnderſtandeth not, nor conſidereth, he neuer eſteemeth this wonderfull mercy of God in redeeming of vs, as he ought: For as hee that ſuppoſeth himſelfe to bee mortally ſicke, highly reckoneth of the Phiſition which cureth him, and he which is troubled but with ſome light infirmity not ſo: Euen ſo, to him, to him onely is the tydings of the Goſpell welcome, the Promiſe ſweete, the Bloud of Chriſt vnualuable, the Loue of God vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3294:77"/>yea, without meaſure, and paſſing all knowledge: which ſeeth his miſery, and ſeeleth his heart wrung with the fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and bolts of ſinne, and which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth of thoſe eternall torments due to the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 2.</hi> Here we ought alſo to conſider, of the Price whereby wee are ranſomed, and of the exceeding Loue of God. For the Price, it was neither gold nor ſiluer, nor any corruptible thing, but the preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bloud of the Lambe vnſpotted Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Marke thou which readeſt:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.18 19.</note> It coſt the very Heart Bloud of Ieſus the Sonne of God, who was without ſinne, to ſaue thee a vile wretch, from eternall damnation which thou deſerueſt by thy ſinnes. The Loue of God herein appeared to be moſt wonderfull, in that he ſpared not his owne Sonne, but gaue him to death, euen for vs and in our ſtead, who were, not his friends, but his very enemies: See what loue the Father hath ſhewed;<note place="margin">Rom. 6.7.8.</note> that thou an Imp of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill by ſinne, ſhouldſt haue the Bloud of Gods owne Sonne ſhed to make thee his ſon or daughter.

Seeing God hath kept thee from being beneath for thine iniquities, and hath granted thee ſuch deliuerance, ſhouldſt thou continue in ſinne? ſhouldſt thou rebell, and returne to breake the Commandement of ſuch, ſo mercifull a God? by drunkenneſſe, blaſphemy, lying, pride, whoredome; or any profaneneſſe? Shouldeſt, thou deſpiſe the Saboaths, Word, Sacraments, Bloud of ſuch a Sauiour? Shouldeſt thou refuſe to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice thy Body and Soule to his glory, that refuſed not to ſacrifice his precious life for thy Saluation?

Which we ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, if we conſider theſe two things: Firſt, what <hi>Adams</hi> ſtate was in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and vpon what conditions it did ſtand. Secondly, the manner of his fall: We will héere intreate of his happineſſe,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 3.</note> and the conditions thereof.

            <p>

Secondly, that they were placed in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> tranſlated, by the <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint, Paradiſe,</hi> and commonly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe it was a place of ſingular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleaſure:<note place="margin">Gene. 2.9. to 15.</note> a moſt pleaſant place, in regarde both of the variety of all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant fruits, (the Trées alſo of knowledge and life in the middeſt thereof) and alſo in regard of the pretious riuers watering the ſame: Vnto this our <hi>Sauiour</hi> allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth when he ſaith to the Thiefe, <hi>This day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> not that Paradiſe wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was put, which was defaced in the flood: but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, ſo called, for the happineſſe, ioy, and riuers of pleaſure which are there for euermore.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the happines of our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents is ſet downe, from their fréedome from all things which might hurt their bodies, or diſturbe their mindes. They were both naked and were not aſhamed.<note place="margin">Gen. 2.25.</note> 
               <hi>They were naked;</hi> Hereby is ſignified, that their bodies had a kinde of Impaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie; ſo that though they were neither hairy nor woolly as other beaſts, nor clad in apparrell, as now; but of a ſoft &amp; ſmooth ſkinne, and naked: yet they were not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect

Thirdly, that in the inferiour parts of the minde and body, there was no inordinat motion or appetite; all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body, and inferiour deſires, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruled and gouerned by the Inward grace of the minde: So that if wée medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of theſe things, we can not but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that the happineſſe of our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents was very great.</p>
            <p>Now we are to conſider of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, on which this happineſſe did ſtand;

            <p>The Commandement was about one of the Trées which were in the middeſt of the Garden, namely the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and euill; which was ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, not of the effect, as though it had a quality to ſharpen the wit, but of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, being a Sacrament of triall and admonition to them, that if they did eate of it, then they ſhould haue wofull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, of the good they had loſt, and of the euil they had gotten, they hauing before a ſpeculatiue knowlege, but not a practical experience hereof.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:3294:81"/>if he continued in his integrity. So <hi>Adam</hi> in his ſtate of innocencie was both mortal, and immortal, in diuers reſpects: Immortall, hauing not an impoſſibilitie of dying, but a poſſibilitiy of not dying, which poſſibility he loſt by his ſinne, and inſtead thereof receiued a neceſſitie of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Thou ſhalt die the death.</hi> Hée was mortall, not becauſe he ſhould haue actually died, if he had not ſinned; but becauſe, if he ſinned, it was poſſible hée ſhould, or hée might die.

            <p>The Diuell, being fallen irrecouerably, comes into the Garden, and in the forme of a Serpent, I meane ſpeaking in, and by a true Serpent, out of a cruell enuy of Mans happineſſe, and an inſatiable deſire of doing hurt, tempts the firſt Woman, and by the Woman, Man to ſinne, and preuailes: He boords the Woman thus: <hi>Yea? Hath God ſaid, ye ſhal not eate?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 1.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaid; It is alikely matter, that God cares what yee eate: What? do you thinke that God ſtands vpon an Apple? It is not to be beleeued: Hath hee created all things for you, and would he not let you vſe all things? This is the firſt aſſault: which the Woman weakely reſiſteth, beginning euen at the firſt to yeeld,<note place="margin">Verſe 2.3.</note> as appeareth by rehearſing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3294:83"/>the commination, or threatning, falſly: For whereas God ſaid;<note place="margin">Gen. 2.17.</note>

            <p>The Diuell perceiuing the Woman to ſtagger, and the wall of her faith to ſhake, plies all his ordinance to the battry. For the word was no ſooner out of her mouth, <hi>Leſt yee dye:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 4.</note> but he replieth: <hi>Yee ſhall not dye at all.</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaid: What? Dye? with eating ſo faire in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?

            <p>This is the fall, of our firſt Parents euen their moſt grieuousſinne: which is not to bée meaſured by the price of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but by the Perſon, whoſe Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is broken; together, with the great reaſon they had to kéepe it, and the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines of performing the ſame. It is thought of ſome to bée the greateſt ſinne pardonable, that euer was committed: and ſurely it was moſt heynous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious to God our Creator; being called the Fall, becauſe it is not one ſinne but many: as, Firſt, Doubting: Secondly, Infidelity: Thirdly, Security: Fourthly, Curioſity, ſeeking wiſedome beſide the Word: Fifthly, Pride: Sixthly, Idolatry, preferring the deuill and his lyes, before God and his Truth: Seuenthly, horrible Vnthankefulneſſe: Eighthly, contempt of God: Ninthly, murder both of themſelues and of their Poſterity, &amp;c.</p>

Secondly, hence we are taught, that if we would be preſerued in the time of temptation; then one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular meanes is to hold faſt the word of God, and to beléeue it: which was the weapon wherewith Chriſt repelled and foyled the deuill in the Wilderneſſe:<note place="margin">Mat. 4.10.</note> when he brought <hi>Eue</hi> to doubt of this, ſhée was eaſily ouercome: ſo if he can bring vs to neglect, contemne, or ſpeake euill of the Word, or but to doubt of the truth of it, hee makes reckoning we are his owne: This is, as if wee ſhould yéeld our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons into our enemies hands, to cut our owne throats, for then we muſt needs bee ouercome, &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3294:88"/>God; and in the ſtead thereof, in the minde, blindneſſe and vanity; in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will, ſtubbornneſſe and rebellion; and in the affections, ſences, and the whole body, grieuous diſorder, contrary to that that ſhould be, and inclinable to all euill: Yea, we may not thinke, that the ſubſtance of body and ſoule, or any faculties, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired; but as in a poyſoned Fountaine, there is the water, and the running, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the wholeſomneſſe is taken away: ſo onely the ſoundneſſe of theſe is loſt, and in the roome therof, all vnſoundneſſe hath taken place. This corruption, which wée thus ſpeake of, hath truely the nature of ſinne, and maketh ſubiect to the wrath of God, as is manifeſt in Infants, which die, though they haue committed no actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all tranſgreſſion,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.14</note> as <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoneth. And this is further to be remembred, that it is not ſo deriued vnto vs, that one hath one part of originall ſinne, and another ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part; but it is wholly in euery one, and is the Séed and Spawne of all ſinne, euen of the Sinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 1.</hi> Hence we ſée, that we are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and guilty of Hell, euen in our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

Euen as therefore, we kill an old Wolfe, or Snake, for the hurt it hath done, or is ready now to do, and alſo all the yong ones for the hurtfull nature they haue, which in time will ſhew it ſelfe: So God may iuſtly caſt, euen Infants, into Hell, for the corruption of their nature, and will, all ſuch of them, which he hath not, by election of grace, ordained to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 2.</hi> Seing there is in euery one, an inclination, through corruption, vnto all ſinne, euen that vnpardonable one: then, if thou haue receiued grace and power to maiſter thy corruptions, acknowledge him who hath diſcerned thée: and when thou ſéeſt a Drunkard, or any other ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wallowing in his ſinne, praiſe God; for thou art of the ſame Mould and Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3294:89"/>and if thou doeſt not the like, it is not the goodneſſe of thy nature; but the mercy of God, reſtraining, or ſanctifying thy corrupt heart. Alſo, let it teach thée, not to deſpaire of thy neighbour, or raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to condemne him, that yet hath not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained grace: For as thou being, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the ſame condemnation, haſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy: ſo what knoweſt thou, how God will deale with him? Rather pray for him, and endeuour to bring him to the partaking of that grace which thou haſt receiued; which is indéed a property of true grace.</p>

And here is the difference betwéen Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and ſuch as are truly renewed: they cut off the branches, theſe the roote: they reforme the action, theſe the affection of ſinne.

            <p>
               <hi>Exp.</hi> The law is taken ſundry waies in the Scripture, héere we take it for the Morall law, contained in the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: we call it an eternall Rule of righteouſneſſe in God: becauſe it is a bright beame iſſuing from the Father of Lights, containing the ſumme of his wil, concerning his worſhiip, and the duety of man vnto him, and to his neighbour. For Gods wil is the rule of all righteouſneſſe; the Law the Copy of it:<note place="margin">Math. 6.10 and 7.21.</note> therefore obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of workes, is called diuerſe times, doing of Gods will, in his word.</p>
            <p>This Law is an eternall rule, becauſe it was alwayes in God, and ſhall for euer continue, euen vnto all eternity, perfectly to be kept in heauen; and alſo to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from the Ceremoniall and Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Lawes, which are abrogated. The Ceremoniall in regard of Vſe and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; and the Iudiciall, in regarde of Obligation: So that, as wee may, at no hand, bring into vſe the Leuiticall Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, ſo we are not bound to the ſame forme of Lawes Politicall, which were
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3294:90"/>giuen to the Common-wealth of the Iewes. And yet the generall equitie of both remaines; of the Iudicialls, that ſinne is to be puniſhed by the Magiſtrate: of the Ceremonialls, that God is to bee worſhipped in the comelineſſe himſelfe hath commaunded: beſides the ſubſtance of theſe Ceremonies, which remaines for euer, Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This Law was at the firſt printed in <hi>Adams</hi> heart; the knowledge and loue thereof, being a part of the Image of God in him. A glimmering whereof God, in his ſingular wiſedome, continued in the heart of man after the fall: namely, ſo much as might ſerue for the continuing of fellowſhip and ſociety amongſt men,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.19.2.15.</note> and which might leaue them without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. This remnant we vſually call the Law of Nature, not that mans nature is the Author of it, but becauſe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the ſame. Afterward the Lord repeated that Law on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and writ it in two tables of ſtone, to conuince the ſtony hearts of men.</p>

Whatſoeuer diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeth, is euill: containing the generall heads of al duties to God and man which can be required. Diuided into two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the firſt containing our duety to God, the ſumme where of is: <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &amp;c.</hi> The ſecond, our duety to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the ſumme whereof is,<note place="margin">Matth. 22.37, 38, 39.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi> Alſo it is diuided into tenne Precepts. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of giuing this law was very ſolemne and terrible:<note place="margin">Deut. 10.4. Exod. 19.</note> worthy to be often read, and marked of all. For the meaning of theſe Commandements, theſe generall Rules are to be obſerued: Firſt, they are to be vnderſtood as the Prophets and Apoſtles haue expounded and taught them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, In all affirmatiue Precepts the negatiue, and in all negatiue, the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue are to be vnderſtood. Thirdly, the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:3294:91"/>maner of ſpeach is to be obſerued, as firſt concerning perſons, by, Thou ſhalt, and ſhalt not; is meant euery one; none are exempted: Secondly, concerning things forbidden or commaunded; vnder one particular named; all of that nature, and kind, with the ſignes, cauſes, and effects, are vnderſtood. Fourthly, the Lawe is ſpirituall, not onely brideling the hands, but the heart and firſt motions thereof. Fiftly, No creature can fully ſée into the depth of the doctrine, and particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it. Sixtly, None can diſpence againſt this Law, but God onely, either in whole, or in part.</p>

               <hi>Vſe 1.</hi> Firſt, we are to praiſe God for giuing the Law, without the which wee could neuer attaine to the knowledge of ſinne, and ſo of our wretchednes thereby; for by the Law comes the knowledge of ſinne.

Therefore when the pride of thine

            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 3.</hi> From the number of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, being tenne, we may profitably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that as they are not many, but few; not confuſed, but orderly; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct; not long and tedious, but excéed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhort: that we ſhould in no wiſe be ignorant of them, the Lord hauing fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them ſo: that they may be carried in minde, as readily as the number of our fingers and toes.</p>

We are carefully to auoyde all, euen the leaſt ſinnes, euen ſinfull thoughts: for (whatſoeuer we thinke) no ſinne is little, but in the account of God; euen vniuſt

No maruell then that the Papiſts, and our Ignorants ſo do vpon the Law, ſéeking to be iuſtified thereby: Surely, if there were no other way to Iuſtification, but by the Law, we ſhould all be damned: but there is another way, which is the obedience of I E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST apprehended by faith, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Firſt therefore the Law ſerues, by the threates of it, to reſtraine vs from ſinne, and to keep and containe vs in obedience: and this is the vſe which the Phariſies and Hypocrites, make onely of it: being indeed proper to the vnregenerate, and therefore alſo dealing with the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, ſo farre as they are vnregenerate: For otherwiſe, as they are ſpirituall, they are a Law to themſelues, and the Law not put for them: they doing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, by the guift of Sanctification, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, that which the Law enioynes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the penalty of the curſe; and would alſo do it, though the Law threatned not: Euen as a mother loues her child of her olune accord, though the Law alſo require the ſame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it ſerues to diſcouer ſinne, and to prouoke it, and to damne it: The firſt and laſt of theſe three, being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to the Law, the ſecond the effect of the law, not of it ſelfe, but through our corrupt nature, which takes occaſion by the Law, which is good, and forbids euill, to bée the worſe: Now in theſe reſpects the

            <p>Thirdly, the Law ſerues for a doctrine, to inſtruct vs; not what to do to be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; but to ſhew vs wherein ſtands our duty to God and man, and what to do to ſhew our ſelues thankefull for our Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 1.</hi> Héere we may take knowledge of the vileneſſe of our Nature; which is the worſe for that, for which it ſhould bée the better, turning that into death which was ordained for life: For euen as a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſtomacke, turnes good meate into the nature of the diſeaſe; ſo till grace come by Chriſt, wée are the worſe for the Law, longing after that which is forbidden. Euen as there was but one Trée forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and that muſt <hi>Eue</hi> haue or none: So is it with vs, our corruption iudging ſtollen waters ſwéeter then thoſe of our Fountaine. For as a Riuer, when the courſe of it is ſtopt, it riſeth and ſwels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the impediment: So doth our vile nature againſt the Law, being ſo much the more euill, by how much the more the Law commands vs to be good. This ſhould ſerue excéedingly to humble vs,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:3294:96"/>and to ſéeke for the renouation of the Spirit, that wée may loue the Law and obey it: For heere is the weakeneſſe of the Law, it ſhewes that which is good, but giues no power to do it: But the Goſpell (teaching vs better then the Law) learnes vs ouer the ſame leſſon againe, and giues power alſo to do the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 2.</hi> Héere alſo we ſée how neceſſary the Preaching of the Law is to prepare men for Chriſt; though it haue no ſkill or power to apply him: Euen as the Néedle is neceſſary, to make a way for the thred whereby the rent is ſowne vp; though it bée the thrid that faſtheth the péece toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not the Néedle, and without the Née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the Thrid cannot do it: Euen ſo it is the Goſpell which bleſſeth the Conſcience with Peace; but firſt the Law muſt make way for the ſame. For euen as the Land is not fit to receiue the Séede, till it bee torne vp with the Plough: So neither are wée fit to receiue Grace vnto Life, till we, being humbled by the Law, be made to ſée what néede we haue of a Redéemer. Of this vſe of the Law wée haue example in <hi>Dauid.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.1.15. Act. 2.37.</note> Examine then how thou cameſt by the perſwaſion thou haſt of grace by
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3294:96"/>Chriſt, if thou wert neuer vnder the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the law, and bruiſed by it, thou art not healed by Chriſt: but if thou cameſt by thy comfort this way, after an vnfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned humiliation by the law, and now thou endeuoureſt, and haſt reſpect to all the commandements thereof, then thou mayeſt haue aſſurance of the goodneſſe of thy eſtate, otherwiſe thou mayeſt iuſtly doubt of it.</p>

               <hi>Expl.

            <p>Now if any ſhould ſay, that it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>méet to thinke, that God ſhould puniſh for the breach of that law which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:3294:97"/>to be kept: It is anſwered, that the law was poſſible to man, as God made him; though it be vnpoſſible, as man made himſelfe.

Fourthly, when we aime at perfection, the Lord in mercy accounting
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:3294:97"/>vs, not as we are, according to the ſtrict rule of his iuſtice, but as we would be through the worke of his Spirit in our hearts.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall obiect, that the workes of the Saints are the workes of the Spirit; therefore perfect: It is ſafely anſwered, that if they were the workes of the Spirit alone, it were true: but they are ſo the workes of the Spirit, that they are our workes alſo, and ſauour of our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as pure water is ſoyled by paſſing through a filthy channell; and good Wine (as it were) tainted by the fuſtineſſe of the Caſke: And further, our actions are to be reputed ſuch, as are the next natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall beginnings in vs from whence they procéed: which are an vnderſtanding, but in part inlightened; and will, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but in part ſanctified by the Spirit.</p>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:3294:99"/>which is the chiefe Tower (as it were) of Chriſtian Religion, againſt all Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſme, and Superſtitions: Which if it be not rightly vnderſtood, it is not poſſible to preſerue the purity of doctrine in other points: Yea, ſome Papiſts haue confeſſed (and it is moſt true) that this doctrine,<note place="margin">Pighius.</note> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth the very foundation of all Popery: their Idolatrous Sacrifice of the Maſſe, their groundleſſe Purgatory, their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious praying to Saints, and for the dead, &amp;c.

            <p>If any ſhall obiect, and ſay; How can I be righteous by anothers Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Suppoſe Chriſts? Why may I not as well be ſaid to liue by the humane Soule of Chriſt, as to be inſtified by his Righteouſneſſe. The anſwere is ready: That thoſe two things are not like, as they are ſuppoſed to be: Becauſe the humane Soule of Chriſt was not giuen him, or appointed to this end to enliue, and informe my bodie: but the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt was appointed by God to this end, that I thereby ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted righteous before him: For the quality, property, or nature of any thing, whereby it is apt and fitte vnto this, or vnto that, is from, and depends vpon the appoyntment of God, the GOD of Nature: the affection of the Creature, whereby it naturally produceth any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, being the effect or creation of God: So that if you aſke, Why doth the Sunne ſhine: the Fire burne? &amp;c. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere; Becauſe GOD hath appoynted them ſo to doe: which appoyntment of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3294:101"/>his is their very nature: As then it is naturall for the Sunne to ſhine, and the fire to burne, and that I ſhould be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the heate, which is in the fire, becauſe God hath ſo appointed: So alſo it is as naturall an effect, for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt to iuſtifie Beléeuers, Becauſe God hath appoynted it to that end and purpoſe. For it falls not out at aduenture, that Chriſts Righteouſnes ſhould be ours; but God in his Eternall Counſell, appoynted Chriſt to be our Suretie, and for his righteouſneſſe ſake, to accept of vs, as if we had béene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly righteous in our ſelues:<note place="margin">Rom. 3.25 26.</note> Therefore wee may bee bolde to truſt to this, in aſmuch as the Scriptures teach, that Chriſt was appoynted, and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe giuen to Beléeuers to this verie end; that in, and by it, their ſinnes might be forgiuen, and they pronounced righteous in him.<note place="margin">1.

            <p>Moreouer, we beléeue that Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: What was that which made him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counſell of his Father ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to death?

            <p>Further, conſider this: The firſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was the roote, and in the ſteade of all mankinde, all of vs partaking of his fleſh and bloud by naturall generation.

Vnderſtand then in a word.

            <p>Secondly, that he is very man, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of our fleſh and bloud, with all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall (not perſonall) infirmities of our Nature, being in all things like vnto vs, yet without ſinne:<note place="margin">Heb 2.14. and 4.15. 1. Pet. 1.19 and 2.22.</note> And therefore wee reade that he was hungry, thirſty, weary, &amp;c. And if you aſke how he could partake of our nature, and yet haue no ſinne? you muſt remember, that he was conceiued by the Holy-Ghoſt, and borne of the virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> The Holy-Ghoſt ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of the ſubſtance of the Virgins<note place="margin">Luk. 1. &amp; 2</note>

            <p>Thirdly, that he is God and Man in one Perſon; figured by the Arke, which was of Gold and precious Wood that would not rot; noting by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Deity of Chriſt, and by the precious Wood, his Humanity without ſinne: This Perſonall vnion of theſe two Natures in Chriſt, was thus. The Sonne of God, being from euerlaſting a Perſon, ſubſiſting in the Holy and vndiuided Trinity, did aſſume, or take, into the Vnty of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a Humane Nature, conſiſting of Body and Soule, ſo ſoone as euer it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to be, hauing no Subſiſtence out of his Perſon, but being deſtitute of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality in it ſelfe, ſo that it becomes the very Body and Soule of the Sonne of God; and whatſoeuer is proper to either Nature (which are not by this meanes, either in Eſſence, or Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, confounded) is indifferently and truely ſpoken of the Perſon: As to make it plaine to the ſimple.</p>
            <p>In our ſelues, vnderſtanding and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:3294:104"/>knowledge, are effects, and workes of the Soule: eating, ſleeping, &amp;c. are workes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Body: Neither doth the Soule eate, or ſleepe, or the Body vnderſtand or know: Yet wée ſay well and truely, that <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> conſiſting of this body and ſoule, vnderſtand, know, eate, ſtéepe, &amp;c. becauſe theſe two Natures, the body and ſoule are vnited in their perſon: And for this cauſe, looke what is well, or ill done, by the body, or any part of it; or by the ſoule, or any part of it, is accounted to the whole Perſon, making the Perſon guilty or not guilty, good or bad: As if the Tongue blaſphemeth, it is ſaid the Perſon blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: or if there be euill motions in the minde, yet the whole Perſon is guilty. So (in ſome ſort) is it in this Perſonall Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe two Natures of Chriſt. As: To know all things, to be preſent euery where, are Proprieties of his Diuine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: To kéep the Law, to die, and to bléed, are Proprieties of the Humane Nature of Chriſt. Now wée may not ſay that the Humane Nature of Chriſt knoweth all things, is omnipotent, &amp;c. Nor that the Diuine Nature is obedient, bléedeth, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, &amp;c. And yet in regard of the Perſonall
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:3294:105"/>Vnion of theſe two Natures in Chriſt: we ſay that the Perſon which hath theſe two Natures (which is Chriſt the Sonne of God) knoweth all things, is preſent euery where, bléedeth, dyeth, &amp;c. and looke what is done, or ſuffered, by either of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is truely done (and ſo accomited) by the whole Perſon: So that if you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Whereby I beleeue, and that moſt infallibly and truly, that whatſoeuer Chriſt did for my ſaluation, is Gods own deed, euen the immediate worke of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon in the Trinity.</p>
            <p>Yet heere one thing muſt be remembred; that though the body and ſoule of <hi>Peter,</hi> make the perſon of <hi>Peter,</hi> yet the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Diuine Nature of Chriſt make not his Perſon: for he was a Perſon from euerlaſting, and cannot bee a Humane Perſon, but is ſtill a Diuine Perſon; though he could not be a Mediator, or execute that Office without the Humane
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:3294:105"/>Nature ſo aſſumed. This is that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Myſtery of our Sauiour <hi>IESVS CHRISTS</hi> Incarnation: Wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred (propounded to our Faith, not to our Reaſon) three the greateſt Miracles that euer were.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was neceſſary that our Mediatour ſhould be God. Two Reaſons alſo there are why he muſt neceſſarily be man; firſt, the Iuſtice of God required, that in that nature which offended, ſatiſfaction ſhould be made: ſecondly, that he might haue ſomthing to offer, which could not be his Godhead: therefore he muſt be Man: Euery high Prieſt muſt offer ſomewhat: therefore a Body was ordained him:<note place="margin">Hebr. 8.3. Heb. 10.5. Hebr. 9.26</note> that he might offer himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Two reaſons alſo may be alleaged why he muſt be God and Man in one perſon: Firſt, that he might be a fit Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene God and Man; as it were, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and equally affected to either ſide: for an Vmpiere, or Wards-man may not be partiall. If he had béene onely God, wée might haue thought, that he would not enough haue reſpected our miſery: If he had béene onely Man, not enough the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3294:106"/>of God. Therefore he is to be God and Man: deare vnto both, and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both deare vnto him: carefull that Gods iuſtice be not impeached, and that our miſery be relieued. Secondly, that the workes performed in the fleſh of the Sonne of God, might be of an infinite price to ſatisfie for our ſinnes, by which an infinite Maieſty was offended: which could not be, if the Perſon vndertaking our Redemption, had not béene God and Man in one Perſon. He was Man, that he might haue ſomewhat to offer: God in the ſame perſon, that ſuch offring might be ſufficient. For the worke of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was performed by the Man-hood, but the vertue and merite was from the God-head.</p>
            <p>And here we haue found out the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt ſhould be of merite ſufficient, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all for thouſand thouſands, euen all the Elect; becauſe it is the righteouſneſſe, and obedience, not of a méere Man, but of God and Man in one perſon: euen of God himſelfe, whoſe goodneſſe and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe muſt néeds be as himſelfe, of infinite merite, forre and vertue. The righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3294:107"/>then of Chriſt, hath this aptitude, or nature, to make all beléeuing ſinners righteous; becauſe it was ſo appointed of God. It hath power and ſufficienty is to doe, becauſe it is the righteouſneſſe of God.</p>

A man may know that which he belieues not to be true: and a man may beléeue a thing to bée true, which yet he may be perſwaded belongs not to himſelfe, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies not vpon it. Diuers wicked men know many things in the Scriptures, which they (like wretches) belieue not to be true: and many beléeue that to be true, which they make not their owne by application; euen as many Hypocrites, &amp; the Diuels themſelues, for they goe thus
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:3294:110"/>farre; but Gods children go further: they know the promiſe, beléeue it to be true, and vpon good grounds are perſwaded it belongs to themſelues: from whence comes confidence. If the Diuell could do this: or if <hi>Iudas</hi> could haue done this, they might be ſaued.</p>
            <p>There are then to be obſerued, three kindes of Faith: Firſt, <hi>Hiſtoricall:</hi> to know and acknowledge the truth of the Bible: Secondly, <hi>Temporary:</hi> when there is alſo a perſwaſion (but not groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) that the promiſe belongs to vs. The third, <hi>True Iuſtifying Faith:</hi> when vnto our knowledge is ioyned acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to this good and warrantable perſwaſion, from whence comes confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>And this laſt kinde of faith hath three properties: Firſt, it is certaine:<note place="margin">Eph. 3.12. Heb. 11.1. 1. Ioh. 3.2.</note> yet there may be, and are doubts: as the man in the Goſpell, <hi>Lord I beleeue, helpe my vnbeliefe:</hi> but doubt commeth from the fleſh: certainty from faith, which in the end ouer-cometh. Secondly,<note place="margin">Luk. 22.32 Rom. 11.29.

For the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man vnderſtandeth not the things of God,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.14</note> but accounteth them fooliſhnes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:3294:116"/>
Wherefore we confeſſe, that man hath ſtil free wil in ciuill and outward things, and vnto euill: but not vnto good: And this freedome vnto ciuill things muſt bee ſo vnderſtood, that he hath power to chuſe or refuſe the obiect: but to do this well he hath no power. Alſo he hath free will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euill, not that he can will or nill euill at his pleaſure; but that without any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, he onely chuſeth euill: ſo that as it may be called free will, becauſe it is free from coaction, ſo alſo bond will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it freely willeth onely that which is euill. And hence it is, that the reprobate ſinne neceſſarily and yet freely; neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe they haue no power to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: freely, becauſe they choſe euill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compulſion: Yea by how much the more neceſſarily they ſinne: by ſo much the more voluntarily they doe it: in as much as their will hath brought vpon them this neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Now when this worke of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Repentance, or Conuerſion is wrought; then we haue free will both to good and euill: to good as farre as we are regenerate by the Spirit: to euill as far as we are vnregenerate and fleſh. And in
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:3294:117"/>the ſtate of Glorification, our will ſhall be free onely to good immutably: as the will of the damned ſhalbe immutably free vnto euill, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith: The firſt <hi>Will</hi> was to haue power not to ſinne, the laſt ſhall be to haue no power to ſinne.</p>
            <p>Then for our purpoſe this is to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that till the ſpirit worke new grace, we haue no power of our ſelues; being vnto the worke of conuerſion meere pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; though in the worke, when the Spirit hath changed and inclined vs, we are co-workers with the Spirit. Before conuerſion we reſiſt: In conuerſion the Spirit inclineth our wills; and of vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling makes them willing to be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to repent: God not working in vs as in ſtockes or ſtones, but as in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures.</p>

For if thou canſt not make one haire of thy head white or black, much leſſe canſt thou change thy vile and corrupt heart. But thou wilt ſay: Doth not GOD promiſe, that at what time ſoeuer a ſinner doth repent, he will be mercifull? Yes; the Lord moſt comfortably (bleſſed be his name) ſaieth ſo: but he ſaith not that a ſinner can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent when he liſt: or that he will giue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, whenſoeuer a ſinner ſhall but whiſtle for it: As <hi>Auguſtine</hi> excellently; He that hath promiſed to all repentants, pardon, hath not promiſed to all delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, repentance, &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>Explic.</hi> When we reade that the olde man, or the body of ſinne, or our earthly members (by which and the like names, the corruption of our nature is called) are are to be mortified, that is, made to die. We are not to vnderſtand it of the life of our bodies, but of the life of ſinne in our bodies. So when our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>If thine eie offend thee, plucke it out, &amp;c.</hi> he meaneth not that we ſhould maime our bodies, but that by all meanes wee ſhould purge out corruption, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts it ſelfe in ſuch members; yea then as wee eſtéeme our corrupt affections as deare as our eyes. Theſe two parts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are alſo called, putting off the olde man, and putting on the new man,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:3294:118"/>&amp;c. whereby is ſignified, that as willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a man puts off his old filthy ragges, to bee clad in ſweete and rich attire, ſo ſhould we willingly put away ſin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are deformed, and labour to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low righteouſnes, which is a part of our Beauty in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>Whereas ſome make thrée parts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; firſt, <hi>Contrition;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>Confeſſion;</hi> thirdly, <hi>Satisfaction:</hi> they deceiue the ſimple. For a man may haue all theſe, and yet be damned, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in <hi>Iudas;</hi> who grieued, confeſſed his ſinne,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.3, 3.</note> and brought againe the thirty pieces of ſiluer, and yet was a reprobate. Theſe may be neceſſary partes of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline enioyned to ſinners, to teſtifie their repentance, as in ancient times; but the eſſentiall parts of repentance, are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually mortification of the olde man, and viuification of the new.</p>
            <p>If you ſhall deſire to know the maner how God works repentance, vnderſtand, that firſt by preaching of the Law, and ſometimes by croſſes, puniſhments, &amp;c. the conſcience is terrified for ſinne, and is ſorrowfull, but in a worldly manner for feare of wrath; for the Law can worke no
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:3294:119"/>otherwiſe: Then, by the promiſe of the Goſpel, the conſcience is chéered through the gift of GOD, in aſſurance of mercy: the ſenſe whereof bréeds an other ſorrow, different from that wrought by the Law, called godly Sorrow; which is, when we are grieued for ſinne, not ſo much becauſe of the wrath following, as becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we haue offended ſo gratious a father: and then followes repentance, which is a changing of the heart and purpoſe vnto a continuall care and indeuour to hate all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7.10</note> and to auoyd it: to loue all goodnes, and to follow it. So that repentance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is the effect of the Goſpel, not of the Law, though the Law be neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare vs thereunto. And hence we ſay it is an effect of Faith, which purifies the heart. Concerning the practiſe of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Sée the Booke called the Nature and Practiſe of Repentance written by our worthy Maiſter <hi>Perkins.</hi>

               <hi>Vſe 1.</hi> Beware of a wonderfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the Diuell, whereby he carries multitudes to hell; which is, when men and women are perſwaded, that if they can ſigh, ſorrow, and wéep for their ſins, that then they truly repent.

               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:3294:119"/>and <hi>Iudas</hi> did thus much and yet frie in hell.

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:3294:120"/>(not vnſpotted, for they regard not ſpots) but vndetected of groſſe euils, ſuch for the which men are carried to the Iayle: who, though they abound with ſmall faults (as they tearme them) hauing prophane hearts, and deſtitute of loue to the truth, and do no good, thinke themſelues among the forwardeſt of ſuch who ſhall be ſaued. But ſoft: the firſt ſtep to heauen, in the practiſe of obedience, is to depart from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: but he that ſets but one ſtep, (and that an ill-fauoured one too) is neuer like to come there: mend that ſtep, and depart from all euill, and ſtep againe, doing the good, and ſo walk on; &amp; then the reward is thine. If thou holdeſt not vp thy hands to any ſtrange God, but if thou worſhippeſt not the true God, thou canſt not be ſaued. If thou ploweſt not, and goeſt not to cart on the Sabaoth day, it is well; but if thou doeſt not the duties of the Sabaoth in the publique and priuate worſhip of God, thou maiſt be damned. As therefore we doe not content our ſelues that no wéeds be in our Gardens, vnleſſe there bée good Hearbes and Flowers: ſo we muſt not onely be void of euill, but filled alſo with the fruits of righteouſneſſe;<note place="margin">Phil. 3.11.</note> being not

               <hi>Vſe 3.</hi> Note, that Repentance, and true conuerſion is a worke of great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: for ſinne cleaues ſo faſt vnto vs, ſitting as cloſe as our ſkinne, and is ſo familiar to our nature, that till God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the heart by the worke of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, it is as eaſie a matter to perſwade a man to leaue his ſinnes, as to get him to endure his eyes to be pluckt out of his head, and his limbes to be torne from his body. Therefore called Mortification, and crucifying the fleſh with the luſts, &amp;c. It is not a ſigh and away, and now and then a few ſorrowfull words will ſerue the turne. No, ſinne is impudent, and will neuer out till it be kild, and caſt out.

               <hi>Expl.</hi> There is nothing more ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Scriptures, then that ſuch ſhall be bleſſed, which endeuour to holineſſe: which muſt not bee ſo vnderſtood, as though we could merite thereby Eternall life, but wee muſt vnderſtand it as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, neceſſarily required in ſuch (being
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:3294:124"/>of diſcretion) which ſhall be ſaued. By which ſpéeches is not meant to ſhew why a man is ſaued, but who they are which ſhall be ſaued.</p>
            <p>When therefore eternall life is called a <hi>Reward,</hi> it is not meant, as though we could deſerue it by our good workes; no not by our faith; but by reward is meant a frée gift, or a gift due by couenant, or promiſe. For there is a double reward: Due, or vndue and frée: the firſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſecond improperly ſo called. That which is due, by order of iuſtice, for the dignity of the worke, is properly a debt, or due Reward: That alſo is ſo called, which is due by fauour, and by promiſe. To our good workes is eternall life as a reward due: not the firſt, but the ſecond way: For God hath made himſelfe our debter, not by receiuing from vs, but by promiſing to vs.</p>
            <p>So that if you take debt, or reward, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, we affirme, that nothing is due to our beſt works: for there are foure things neceſſary to make a worke meritorious in the firſt acception of debt: Firſt, that the grace whereby we do it, be our owne: for if we receiue it from another, it is againſt
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:3294:125"/>reaſon, that he that giues, ſhould thereby be indebted to giue more:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.7.</note> 
               <hi>But wee haue no grace, but we haue receiued it.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it muſt not be due, or duty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it: for that is contrary to merit; but all that we are able to doe, if it were more, is due, in regard of Creation, and Redemption.<note place="margin">Luk. 17.10</note> Thirdly, it muſt be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, to whom it is done: But God is not benefited by vs.<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.2. &amp; 50.11.12 13.

Secondly, Spirituall of the ſoule, in the vnion of it with God, and Chriſt;<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20. Eph. 2.17.</note> whereby Chriſt is ſaid to liue in vs. Thirdly, Eternall of body &amp; ſoule, whereby the elect liue and reigne for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more in the kingdome of Heauen. The firſt is common to the Reprobates, with the Elect: the other two are proper to the Elect. Eternall death is alſo thrée-fold: Firſt, naturall of the body, in the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of body and ſoule: called naturall, not that it doth properly procéed from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for it is the effect of ſinne; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is according to corrupt nature, by the iuſtice of God. Secondly, ſpirituall, in the ſeparation of the ſoule from God, whereby ſinne liues and reignes in the wicked, being ſaid alſo to be dead in ſinne. Thirdly, Eternall, whereby body and ſoule ſhall be for euer ſeparated from God and Chriſt, and liue with the Diuell in
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:3294:126"/>eternall torments; which kinde of life is called death, becauſe it were ten thouſand times better not to liue at all, in reſpect of themſelues, then in ſuch endleſſe, eaſleſſe, and remedileſſe miſery.</p>
            <p>For eternall life may be conſidered, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of the creature, as it is, and continueth by the power of the Creator, &amp; ſo the wicked ſhal liue eternally in hell: or in reſpect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> adiuncts of life, or the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which the creature ſhal haue toward the Creator, and the fauour of God in Chriſt; and ſo the Elect ſhall only liue for euer.</p>
            <p>In a word, the happineſſe of the one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and the miſery of the other, is ſuch, as no tongue is able to expreſſe, no heart able to conceiue: Al the glory and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of this life, being ſcarce a ſhadow of the glory to be reuealed: the firſt fruits whereof are in this life, in the peace and ioy of a good conſcience:<note place="margin">Rom. 14.17.</note> which though it be vnſpeakeable, and as a Heauen vpon Earth, yet is no more, nor ſo much to that which ſhall be, then a handfull of corne is to a field of a thouſand acres.<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.1.2.</note> So alſo the torments which we can any wayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe to bee inflicted vpon man in this
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:3294:126"/>world, being but a flea-biting to Hell, and a ſparke of that flame which the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there ſhall endure: and yet when wicked men féele the flaſhings of it in their conſciences, in the middeſt of all their worldly pleaſures, they are horribly confounded, as in the example of <hi>Caine, Saul, Balthaſar, Iudas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 18.14</note> and as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies.</p>
            <p>As there are but two Eſtates, ſo but two places, Heauen and Hell: As for a third place, called Purgatory, neither doth the Scripture mention it, neither can the Deuiſers, and firſt Founders of it, the Papiſts, tell what to make of it: and therefore wee acknowledge it not.</p>

               <hi>Vſe 1.</hi> Séeing ſuch torments remaine for them in Hell which repent not of their ſins, vſe all poſſible care that thou come not there: Helpe thy ſelfe againſt ſin, and all damnable ſecurity in it, by thinking of the torment following. In regard of thy ſelfe, it had béene better thou hadſt neuer béene borne, then to haue thy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding with thoſe vgly Fiends in that ſame euerlaſting Fire and Brimſtone: Let not therefore the bitter pleaſures of

Is ſinne ſwéete? But death is bitter: remember it: Thy ſinne, and the pleaſure of it, is ſhort: but the ſhame and torment following is without end: and that in Hell: where one minute of torment ſhall ſwallow vp the very memory of all fore-paſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: Labour to thinke often of Hell, it will bée ſome meanes to kéepe thée from thence, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>

It is our duty to liue godly, though no reward were propounded; but when our endeuours (which yet are weake) ſhall bee ſo beyond all proportion, rewarded with ſuch an eternall weight of glory; how ſhould it whet on our care, and ſpurre vs forward to pleaſe ſuch a God, who is

How ſhould it prouoke vs to labour to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained into his ſeruice, whoſe ſeruants after a little obedience here performed, are made Kings and Quéenes in Heauen for euermore? Who would not be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling through fire and water, and all the miſeries of this life, to goe to that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the Citty of Saints, to haue eternall fellowſhip with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Patriarkes, Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, and all our deare friends, which haue beléeued: yea with Ieſus Chriſt our Princely Redéemer, in the glory of the Father? If thou haſt prophanely ſaid, or thought, what profite ſhall I haue if I ſerue God? See here, and be aſhamed: for ſuch as ſerue God, ſhall partake of the ſwéetneſſe of <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, of the delights of Paradiſe, of the melody of their Fathers houſe, of their Maiſters Ioy, that fulneſſe of Ioy, of the Riuers of pleaſure for euer, of an Inheritance that neuer fadeth, but is immortal in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens: where whatſoeuer we can loue, we ſhall haue, and wee ſhall deſire nothing which wee haue not; where there is ſo much happineſſe, as neither the eye hath
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:3294:128"/>ſéene, nor heart can thinke. What mayeſt thou thinke of thy ſelfe, which liueſt ſo, as if heauen and the ioyes thereof, were not worth the while? Doeſt not thou loue &amp; labour for this tranſitory &amp; miſerable life? Why not then much more for that which is permanent in happineſſe vnconceiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? Oh! if thou kneweſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth piety, and the terror of that death that followeth ſin, it would make thée wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to redéeme that life, though it were with a thouſand yeares torment euen in Hell; which now is offered to thée by a ſhort co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance in holy obedience.

            <p>We ſay that Election and Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are the free Counſell and Purpoſe of God, &amp;c.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:3294:138"/>whereby he purpoſed to create him: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby he purpoſed to create him according to his Image; which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be too curious, becauſe at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant that man was, he was according to the Image of God: and ſo God conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him onely and alwayes, becauſe he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was otherwiſe (vnleſſe we would ſay, that the inward act of Gods purpoſe is different from the outward, which I thinke is not to be granted:) And likewiſe ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> bringeth in the Trinity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting, as it were: <hi>Let vs make Man according to our Image;</hi> noting, as I thinke, one vndiuided act of the purpoſe of God, when he conſidered the Creation of Man. I would not therefore ſay, that the naked Maſſe is the ſubiect of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination: nor that God paſſeth by men, onely as they are men, and not as they are corrupt: For this were to make the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of Gods Predeſtination to be améere notion, or a conceit onely of the minde; becauſe that man was neuer but in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of holineſſe, or corruption: Neither doth the ſimilitude of the Potter proue it as farre as I can conceiue.<note place="margin">Rom. 9.21</note> The meaning of which place I take to be this: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:3294:138"/>thereby ſtoppeth the murmuring and cauilling mouth of the Reprobate, who preſumptuduſly ſay, Why are wee aproued? and why doth God complaine of vs for breaking his will?

If the Potter haue power of the ſame naked lampe to make a veſſell to honour, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to diſhonour: ſhall not God much more haue power, of a corrupted lumpe of mankinde, to make veſſels of wrath?</hi> Which (in my ſimple vnderſtanding) doth better take away all reaſoning from the Reprobate, and ſtoppe their mouthes, then to expound it of Gods abſolute Right: For ſimilitudes are not to be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed too farre: it is brought againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, and there is no correſpondency and likeneſſe betwéene the Potters naked maſſe, and the naked maſſe of mankinde; becauſe the Potters maſſe, though na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, is a thing really, and indéed extant by it ſelfe, though the Potter make neuer a
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:3294:139"/>Pot of it: So is not the naked maſſe of mankinde extant really, but only in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. And therfore I would not preſſe a ſimilitude in that wherein there is us likeneſſe.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall obiect and ſay: Hath not God abſolute right, authority, ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; power ouer his creature? I anſwere, Yes: and he may do with his owne, what he will; who ſhall let him? Neither doth any thing I haue ſaid, inferre the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And yet that God doth, or will vſe an abſolute right toward the creature (as to caſt it away without any deſert of it) I ſée not yet by the Scriptures. This I ſée, that what God may doe, I may not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute: but what he wil do, I muſt enquire and beléeue according to his word, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he can do the ſame.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall ſay further, God maketh veſſels of wrath, but if he ſhould conſider man fallen, he ſhould finde them made: I deny the conſequence: for a man fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> is then ſaid to be made a veſſell of wrath, when God for his ſin decréeth his reiecting and puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Beſide, to hold the corrupted maſſe is agréeable to that receiued doctrine of the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:3294:139"/>Ancients, that God forſakes none penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but ſuch as forſake him. This alſo beſt ſtoppeth the mouth of Reprobates, and taketh away all reaſoning from them, (as was ſaid) when they muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that there was matter in them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>For the ſecond Propoſition, that God conſidered not man good, is plaine; becauſe all promiſes of Gods eternal fauour, both before the fall, and after the ſame, are made in the Scriptures to them which are good (either by Creation, or Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and which continue in the ſame.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Election, and Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be conſidered eyther abſolutely, as that God elected or reprobated theſe: or that he elected or reprobated theſe, and not theſe. If you aſke why God elected
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:3294:140"/>theſe: I anſwer, that his ſole will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the leaſt reſpect in the Creature, was the cauſe of it: If you aſke why God elected theſe, and not thoſe, as <hi>Iacob,</hi> and not <hi>Eſau:</hi> I anſwere after the ſame manner. If you aſke why God reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth theſe rather then theſe: I anſwer as before, that there is no cauſe thereof in the Creature, but onely in him, which is his will. If alſo you ſhall aſke why did God reprobate theſe: I anſwere, that his will alſo is the onely cauſe thereof in this ſenſe, namely, that it was in Gods frée power notwithſtanding ſinne, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or not elect, to reprobate or not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate: For God was not compelled by the ſinne he conſidered in man to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate him, for he might haue elected the ſame man in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> if he had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And yet this we adde, that in repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of theſe, God had reſpect to mans ſinne (not actuall infidelity or ſinne, but originall) not as a principall efficient, or as a cauſe firſt moouing, for God might haue not reprobated, if he had ſo pleaſed: but as a cauſe deſeruing reprobatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or as a neceſſary condition in the obiect, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which GOD will not reprobate any.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:3294:140"/>For neither doth God in time deny his grace to any, but to thoſe who deſerue to be denied: neither decrées he before time to deny it, but vnto ſuch. And whereas ſome will ſay, An vniuerſall cauſe brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth an vniuerſall effect: If then ſinne be vniuerſall, why is not Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? I anſwer, that an vniuerſall cauſe bringeth forth ſuch effect actually, if it be not hindered by a ſuperiour ouer-ruling cauſe. And ſo I yéelde that it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true of ſinne to depriue all of Grace and Glorie;<note place="margin">Rom. 3.23</note> and would haue this effect vpon all mankind, if God ſhould ſhew no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: and the reaſon it hath not, is, becauſe God is pleaſed out of his botomleſſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to accept of ſome, and to elect them in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 1.</hi> Beware of ſearching too farre into this déepe, without the light of the Word: The plaine way is the ſafeſt, and in as much as the Scripture hath more ſparingly ſpoken of Reprobation then E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection: Doe thou labour more to make thy election ſure vpon good grounds, then to conceiue euery quiddity of men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Reprobation.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 3.</hi> Beware of that damnable ſpeach of profane men, who ſay: If I be predeſtinated, and Gods decrée muſt take effect, then I may doe what I will: for if I be appointed to ſaluation, I ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: and if to damnation, I ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whatſoeuer I doe. Which is all one, as if one ſhould ſay, God hath decréed that I ſhall liue or die; If he hath appoynted life, I ſhall liue, though I eate not at all, or though I eate poyſon, if he hath appoynted death, tis not eating or not eating will ſaue me: therefore I will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not eate at all, or I will eate poiſon: then which collection there can bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſottiſh.</p>
            <p>If a man be reprobate, he ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be damned, doe what he can: Tis moſt true. But yet remember, ſuch an one,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:3294:141"/>can (nay will) doe nothing, but that which ſhall more and more bring his damnation vpon him: For the horrible diſeaſe of finne, not being healed by Chriſt (as it is only in the Elect) muſt néeds bring forth fruit vnto death. Indéed if a Reprobate, had power to doe good and to repent, and yet for all that, and doing ſo, he ſhould be damned by the neceſſitie of Gods will, there might be ſome colour: but to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is to be left in originall ſinne, which is the fountaine of all tranſgreſſions: and the perſons ſo left, are iuſtly ſo left, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are left guilty in <hi>Adam:</hi> and can do no good vnleſſe God did giue them new grace, which he is not bound to doe, and they haue deſerued not to receiue. Likewiſe, if a man be elected, hee muſt néedes be ſaued, not that God hath ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to ſaue any abſolutely without grace; but whomſoeuer he hath elected to ſaue, he hath elected alſo to beléeue and repent, that they may be capable thereof. For God did as well decrée the meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſhould be ſaued, as that we ſhould be ſaued: which meanes are the merite of Chriſt, effectuall calling, Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Faith, Repentance, &amp;c. which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:3294:142"/>attaineth may certainely conclude that he is elected, and ſhall be ſaued, as he that wanteth them to the end, may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely conclude, that he ſhall not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and therefore neuer was elected. Wherefore, by the workes of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, make thy Election ſure, as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> aduiſeth thée:<note place="margin">2.

Theſe notes haue their degrées: the more pure they are, the more pure is the Church which hath them: the leſſe pure they are, the leſſe pure is a Church to bee accounted: and where they are not all, or wholely adulterated, there, either is no Church, or a very corrupt one: Now though Diſcipline be allowed, and neceſſarily required to the well being of a Church: yet a Company holding <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and maintaining the Scriptures, though they ſhould want Diſcipline, are a true, though a defectiue Church. It is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, to vſe Diſcipline: but as a wife ceaſeth not to be a true wife, for the neglect of houſhold gouernement, ſo long as ſhe kéepeth the mariage oath to herhuſband vnbroken: ſo a Church cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not to be a true Church for ſome ſaults, or neglects, ſo long as ſhe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth her head <hi>Chriſt</hi> according to the Word.</p>

And if thou ſtandeſt vpon a right conſtitution, remember that the replan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Goſpell here, were Kings and Princes, and not without the preaching of the word. Remember that the people of the land were not conuerted from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſme by them, as ſuch which had no knowledge of Chriſt, but from Papiſme, vnder which they had ſome knowledge of him. Remember that if the Church were not rightly conſtituted by Quéene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> neither was it by King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, and ſo thou wrongeſt the aſhes of the Martyrs, as if they were not Martyrs of Chriſt, but of Antichriſt: And ſay that there was ſomething wanting in the firſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: cannot God forgiue it?

            <p>This calling is either Inward or Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The Inward is the good teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our hearts, that not through ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or couetouſneſſe, &amp;c. we ſéeke and accept of ſuch office, but onely through a ſincere deſire in the feare of God, to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and build vp Gods Church. And this calling muſt be in all who would approue
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:3294:146"/>their Miniſtery to God. The outward is that which is according to the comely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Church, and it is Ordinary, or Extraordinary.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.

            <p>Extraordinary calling is that which is immediately from God, without the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of man before ſpoken of, as the calling of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> And this is not to be expected, or pretended in an eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Church: But when the ſtate of a Church is wholly decayed, or interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: God doth extraordinarily ſtirre vp, and endue with anſwerable gifts, ſome to reſtore the ſame. There are foure rules to be obſerued in the examining of ſuch a Calling: The firſt is concerning the time and place; whether it be there and then: where, and when, there is no vſe or poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of lawfull ordinary calling: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, concerning the life and doctrine of ſuch:<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.39.

Where there is an extraordinary calling pretended, and not according to theſe Rules, it is to be accounted a deceit and wicked impoſture, and ſuch which pretend the ſame to be of the number of thoſe of whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh.<note place="margin">Rom. 16.18</note>

               <hi>Expl.</hi> God is the Authour of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and none can adde any to the Word but God: Now God added them to the Word, not that the Word was not ſufficient without them, but for a helpe to our weakeneſſe, that wée might haue, as it were, liuely pawnes before our eyes, of thoſe things which wee heare with our eares (as euen <hi>Adam</hi> had Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:3294:148"/>in Paradice) and theſe he ordained to be Seales of the couenant of Grace, which was not néedfull on Gods part, who is alwaies better then his word; but it was néedfull for vs, to ſuccour whoſe weakeneſſe (who in regard of our vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, are prone to doubting) the Lord hath added them to giue vs greater aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; euen as a Seale to a Writing makes it more Authenticall.</p>
            <p>The Eſſentiall parts of a Sacrament, are either outward, or inward: The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hath the ſigne, with the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ordained, and the Word: As in Baptiſme, the outward ſigne is Water, the Ceremony is the ſprinkling: The word is the word of Inſtitution and Promiſe: <hi>Baptiſe them, &amp;c.

            <p>The inward matter is the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: which is both the Bloud and Spirit of Chriſt, and our Inciſion, and Graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and Incorporation into him by the Holy Ghoſt, with all benefites following; As imputation of Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Remiſſion of ſinnes, Adoption, Receiuing into the Communion of Saints, Regeneration, &amp;c. For as the Water waſheth the filthineſſe of the body, ſo the Bloud of Chriſt waſheth away our ſpirituall filthineſſe, through the Spirit: which Spirit, makes vs fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in good workes, and abateth our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires of earthly things; euen as water maketh things fruitfull, and quencheth bodily thirſt. And this ſo ſurely, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the true and Myſticall vnion, of the Signe, and Things ſignified, by the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:3294:149"/>bond of Faith; that for our aſſurance the worke of the Spirit is often attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Signe (as Baptiſme regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and ſaueth) becauſe ſuch is the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vnion of the Signe, and the grace ſignified thereby, in regard of the truth of God, on the one ſide offering, and faith on the other ſide receiuing; that whoſoeuer beléeueth may as verily be aſſured of receiuing the thing ſignified in his ſoule, as he is made partaker of the ſigne in his body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 1.</hi> In as much as the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are Significations, and Seales, of ſuch excellent things, they are with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to be handled and eſtéemed, euen as meanes which exhibite to vs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the beſt bleſſings of God: In regard therefore of their vſe by inſtitution, they are things vnualuable: though in regard of that which is ſubiect to the eye they bée of little price.</p>
            <p>Eſtéeme then, not according to their outward valew, but according to the bleſſing annexed in their lawfull vſe, and looke more vnto the gift, then the meanes or manner of giuing: For God meaſureth our contempt, or irreuerence in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:3294:150"/>not according to the worth of the Elements; but according to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite offered in and by them: As the thing wherein <hi>Adam</hi> tranſgreſſed was but an Apple, but the manner of ſinning, euen in that Apple, was moſt heynous.</p>
            <p>As therefore men eſtéeme of their Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, not according to the value of the Paper and Waxe, but according to their vſe: So are we to conſider of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>The Water in Baptiſme, and the Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper, are but ſmall matters: Yet no Bread or Wine in the world, none, the moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous water that is, or can be diſtilled, though a drop were worth a Kingdome, may be compared vnto theſe, but in the like vſe. <hi>Adamah</hi> and <hi>Pharphar,</hi> Riuers of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> fairer then <hi>Iordan,</hi> yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cleanſe the leproſy: So there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waters which comfort the heart; but none but this cleanſeth the ſoule &amp; ſaueth it. Wherefore all Miniſters, Parents, and People, are reuerently to cary them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, in, or at the adminiſtration of the holy Sacrament of Baptiſme: and if they ſlightly reckon thereof (as in too many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

But wholely breake thou thy promiſe, and thou ſhalt neuer taſte of the good bleſſings of GOD promiſed to thée.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more profitable then Baptiſme, yet it profited not <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> becauſe he wanted the inuiſible wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the Spirit: therefore, if thou wouldſt make the beſt profite of thy bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, walke then in all holy obedience, and vnfainedly repent of thy ſinnes; yea thou arte bound vnto it: Euen as the Souldier by his preaſt money to ſerue in the warres: ſo thou by this holy marke and character, which thou haſt receiued of God, art bound to his ſeruice.</p>

            <p>The word is the Promiſe added to the Signe in theſe words; <hi>This is my Bodie which is giuen for you; This is my blood which &amp;c.</hi> together with the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in theſe words; <hi>Doe this, &amp;c.</hi> The element doth repreſent the inuiſible grace of the which the word ſpeaketh, and the Word declareth what the inuiſible grace is, which is repreſented and ſealed by the Element. The outward Signe then in this Sacrament, is the Bread and Wine as I haue ſpoken. The inward Grace, is the Body and Bloud of <hi>Chriſt</hi> giuen, and ſhead for our ſinnes; and the Spirituall eating and drinking of them, whereby is ſignified our Vnion with <hi>Chriſt</hi> by faith, by the which we drawe from him Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, Ioy, and eternall life, according to an excellent Analogie in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Now theſe two, the Signe, and the thing ſignified, are vnited by the Word
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:3294:153"/>in the lawfull vſe of this Sacrament: which Vnion is only Sacramentall, and relatiue, wherby the ſigne is not changed into the thing ſignified; nor the thing ſignified contained, in, vnder, or in the place of the Signe: but by the Signe the thing ſignified is repreſented, offered, and ſealed in the lawful vſe to Beléeuers. For Grace is not ſo tied to the Sacrament, that whoſoeuer partakes of the Signe, ſhould alſo of the thing ſignified; or as none could partake of the thing ſignified, without the Signe: For the vnbeléeuers may haue the Lords Bread in their mouthes, which neuer haue <hi>Chriſt</hi> in their hearts; as Beléeuers may taſte of the ſwéetneſſe of the Lord in their ſoules, which (where it can not be had) partake not of the Bread and Wine, which are the outward Signe.</p>

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:3294:154"/>But as being borne, we often eate to be nouriſhed, and to grow: ſo we are often to communicate and to come to the Lords Table: firſt, that we may grow in Faith: ſecondly, that we may haue occaſion to ſtirre vp our dulneſſe, both to conſider of, and to be thankfull for the death of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> thirdly, that we may teſtifie our Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> fourthly, that we may kéepe Vnity, and nouriſh Charity: fiftly, that wee may immitate the Apoſtolicall church, who ſeldome came together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the word, prayer, breaking of bread, &amp; almeſgiuing.

            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 1.</hi> Prepare thy ſelf often to come to the Lords Table, if occaſion fitly be offered: that thou tempt not GOD by neglecting his ordinance appoynted for the confirmation of thy Faith: And that thou maiſt performe his commandement, who ſaith: <hi>Do this often in remembrance of me.</hi> And <hi>that thou maiſt ſhew foorth the Lords death till hee come.</hi> Conſider then, is once or twice a yeare enough for
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:3294:154"/>thy diſcharge herein? Canſt thou ſo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the remembrance of his torments, who was bruiſed for thy ſins, and which bore thine iniquities? who hath deliuered thée from Hell, and purchaſed Heauen for thée by his bloud? Thy Sauiour paſſing out of this world by a moſt bitter paſſion for thée, commends himſelfe to thée, and commands thée to remember him; and to teſtifie this, and thy thankfulneſſe for his death, to come often to his Table: How then doeſt thou not ſhewe thy ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull, and forgetfull, which when occaſion is offered, churliſhly turneſt thy backe? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 2. He that eateth and drinketh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, eateth and drinketh Iudgement to himſelfe.</hi> Beware therefore how thou preſumeſt to come to the Lords Table without thy wedding garment, without preparation. Holy things require holy v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: firſt labour for faith, both to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what the Myſtery is, that thou mayſt diſcerne the Lords body, and alſo to receiue the grace that is offered therein: which without faith thou receiueſt not. He that beléeueth hath benefite vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the ordinances of God: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:3294:155"/>faith all is to vs in vaine. Euen as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euidences of another mans land, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing auaileable to me, but to the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder they are of ſingular vſe: So the Sacraments are part of the euidences of a beléeuers hope, and ſeale to him Gods fauour; but to vnbeléeuers they ſeale no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but their greater condemnation, if they repent not. Euen as if an vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man open a booke, he ſéeth the letters, but is neuer the better, and cannot attaine the meaning; but a man that is learned, readeth, and is inſtructed: So an vnbelée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſéeth the Bread and Wine, and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſigne; but the beléeuer onely hath the benefite of the thing ſignified, through his faith: For the ſpirituall grace is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, not to the ſigne, but to the perſon beléeuing. Euen as <hi>Pharoh</hi> had a dreame, but not the interpretation, and as the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man of <hi>Samaria</hi> ſaw the plenty, but taſted not of it: Euen ſe vnbeléeuers, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norants, vnthankefull for the death of Chriſt, haue the ſhell, but not the kyrnell; haue that which goeth into the body, not that which bleſſeth the ſoule. Firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore get faith.</p>
            <p>Secondly, repent of thy ſins, hauing
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:3294:155"/>an vnfained and ſtedfaſt purpoſe alwaies hereafted to liue godlily. If thou comeſt with a hungring deſire of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, with a broken heart for that which is paſt, and with a holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for the time to come: then thou art welcome to thy Sauiour, and ſhalt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faile, taſte of his ſwéetneſſe; but if thou haſt béene, and yet art, a Drunkard, a Blaſphemer, Vncleane, Proud, Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, Contentious, &amp;c, and haſt not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly repented, or at leaſt doeſt not begin to repent: For this cauſe thou art guilty of the body and bloud of Chriſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more fit to be at the méetings of Turkes and Infidels, then of ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Ieſus Chriſt. Get therefore Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance alſo. And teſtifie this thy repentance not onely by a ſhew of ſorrow and ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the day thou comeſt to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but all the dayes of thy life after. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haue I ſéene, which on that day haue gone ſoftly, ſpoken patiently, looked ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully, behaued themſelues grauely; which within a day or two, haue with the ſwine returned to the wallowing in the mire; and, with the dogge, to the vomit of their former euill courſes. But vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:3294:156"/>thou, that euen as when a man hath eſcaped the danger of ſome great diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of ſurfeit, it is not enough for him to kéepe a good dyet a day or two: So it is not a dayes obedience, or two, nor ſuch fits of deuotion, which vaniſh as a flaſh of lightning, that will approue our faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and profeſſion; but it is perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance in theſe holy duties, when the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the Sacrament remaines with vs all the daies of our life. Therfore euen as <hi>Daniel</hi> was the fairer and better fauoured by his dyet of <hi>Pulſe:</hi> ſo it is required, and the Lord erpects, that if thou eate &amp; drinke at his table, thou ſhouldeſt be the fairer by it, and the better reformed in thy conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: And if thou béeſt notwithſtanding ill-fauoured, that is, without Knowledge, Faith, Repentance, Obedience, Patience, Temperance, Charity, &amp;c. it is a manifeſt argument that thou haſt a foule and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted conſcience, that thou haſt receiued vnworthily, and ſo art in danger of the wrath of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu. <hi>You ſaid, that ſome thinke Diſcipline to be a note of the true Church: What is that Diſcipline?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. <hi>It is that power in the Church, by
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:3294:156"/>the conſent and approbation of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrate; whereby, by perſons fit and lawfully called, Conſtitutions are made,</hi>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.3.4. &amp; 14.40.</note> 
               <hi>both for comelineſſe and order in the worſhip of God, and for the cenſuring of prophane liuers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Expl.</hi> Though a true Church may bée without this power of Diſcipline, yet bée well without it, it cannot; both that the miniſtery of the holy things may with the greateſt reuerence and profite be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and alſo that the Church may be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and a maintainer thereof: Firſt then, becauſe without order things cannot well procéede, or continue, and God is the God of order, the hold that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to make Canons and Conſtitutions: but with a thrée-fold reſtraint: Firſt, that they be onely about matters Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call: Euery man is to kéepe within the compaſſe of his calling. Secondly, that as concerning the worſhip of God, they be determinations of circumſtances, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp; profitable, as concerning time, place, order, méetings, maner of reading Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp;c. In all which, comelineſſe, order, edification of the Church, &amp; auoiding of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence are to be reſpected: and ſuch determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:3294:157"/>in their owne nature to remaine mutable, &amp; to be altered, as the Magiſtrate ſhall ſée it make for the good of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church. Thirdly, that if there be a Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, they be with his conſent and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: becauſe the authority of making &amp; confirming lawes, concerning both the ciuill &amp; Eccleſiaſticall good of the ſubiects, is principally in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe ciuil Magiſtrate. This order being obſerued, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call things, as diſpenſation of the Word &amp; Sacraments, and execution of Diſcipline be handled; not by lay perſons, but by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall perſons onely, by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God and the Prince.</p>
            <p>For the other part, which concerneth Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, this is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that properly they are not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by mulcts, fines, hodily ſmart, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, death, &amp; ſuch like, which are proper to the power of a ciuill Magiſtrate; but by admonition,<note place="margin">Mat. 20.25 26. 1. Pet. 5.3.</note> reproofe, ſuſpenſion, &amp; excommunication. The higheſt degrée of Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, is excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when notorious &amp; ſtubborne offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are caſt out of the Church, the parties deſeruing this cenſure, being notorioufly prophane, and there being extreme danger
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:3294:157"/>of offence, and of the infection of others by their ſociety. In the execution whereof, procéeding muſt be, as in the body, in the cutting of a member; which is, when no meanes will recouer it, and leaſt it ſhould procure decay to the whole body, then to cut it off, though it be with griefe.</p>
            <p>Alſo, excommunication is not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be executed, but on the contumacy of the delinquent: for the party, as a loſt ſhéepe is both carefully to be ſought vp, &amp; if he repent, to be with all reioycing &amp; loue, receiued againe into the fellowſhip of the Church: for the end of excommunication muſt be: firſt, that holy things be not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to dogges. Secondly,<note place="margin">Math. 7.7.</note> that the Church may frée herſelfe from an euill fame, of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring them which diſhonor God. Thirdly,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 1. Cor. 5.6.</note> leſt others be infected. Fourthly, that ſuch as offend may be aſhamed, and come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,<note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 3.14. 1. Cor. 5.5.</note> that their Spirits may be ſaued in the day of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And this order of cenſuring offenders, &amp; excommunication, ought to be perpetuall in the Church; becauſe the cauſes thereof are vniuerſal &amp; perpetuall, which are thoſe foure before mentioned, together with the commandement of Chriſt:<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:3294:158"/>that the inceſtious perſon ought to be excommunicated in the name of Chriſt, that is, by his authority, &amp; according to his commandement: yea, &amp; this to be in force in all Churches, euen which are vnder Chriſtian Magiſtrates: for otherwiſe doth the ciuill Magiſtrate puniſh, otherwiſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church. The Church aimeth at the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offender: the ciuill Magiſtrate at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> execution of iuſtice. The Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth not to excommunication, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> delinquent repenteth &amp; obeyeth.

               <hi>Expl.</hi> One of the greateſt bleſſings which God hath giuen to men, is Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Gouernment, without which through confuſion, all things would ſoone come to ruine: For as a Ship without a Pilot, ſo is a Company, or Society, of men, without a King, or other lawfull Magiſtrate: Therefore it was well ſaid of <hi>Tacitus; That it is better to haue an euill Prince then none:</hi> And of <hi>S. Chryſoſtome; It is better to haue a Tyrant, then no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour:</hi> And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scripture maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the ſtate of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was neuer worſe (while they were a free people) then when they were without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Gouernours: Yea Nature, euen in reaſonleſſe &amp; bruite creatures, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Order &amp; Gouernment, as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bées, &amp;c. This great benefite came from the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:3294:160"/>Lord, as all other good things.</p>
            <p>The prime care of the Soueraigne Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate muſt be to maintaine the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Law: <hi>Kiſſing the Sonne, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing homage vnto Chriſt:</hi> and therefore to maintaine the true worſhip of God, and to forbid, and vtterly to extirpate, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: And yet this ſo to be vnderſtood, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neceſſity of dangerous times, he may ſuffer ſuch as are ſuperſtitious, and do erre; that ſome Common-wealth and Religion may be had, rather then none at all. It belongs to the Prince, to ſée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the true Doctrine be taught; but to adminiſter the ſame, &amp; teach it in publique, it belongs to Miniſters and Eccleſiaſticall perſons: It belongs to his Authority to appoint or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary iudgements Eccleſiaſticall, to maintaine Schooles, Vniuerſities, &amp;c. wherby fit Biſhops &amp; Miniſters may beſet ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Flock of Chriſt, &amp; to make lawes, whereby ſuch Paſtors &amp; Teachers, may be directed, corrected, ſuſpended, depriued, as matters ſhall require. It is his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which may call and moderate, Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionall. Nationall, Generall Syneds, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Faſts, &amp;c. Yea, he ought to puniſh Heretickes, Idolaters, Blaſphemers, &amp;c.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:3294:160"/>as well as Murtherers, Théeues, &amp;c. and to do all things which may further y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good of his Subiects, and to take away the contrary:<note place="margin">Rom. 13.4.</note> 
               <hi>For he beareth not the Sword in vaine.</hi> So <hi>Moſes</hi> appointed the worſhip of God, &amp; preſcribed it to <hi>Aaron; Dauid</hi> diſpoſed the Miniſtery of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, called a Conuocation, or Synode, for the bringing of the Arke: <hi>Salomon</hi> dedicated the Temple, depoſed <hi>Abiathar: Iehoſhaphat</hi> commanded the Prieſts and Elders to viſite the Churches, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worſhip of God: As alſo did other good Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> as appeareth in their Stories, which they did not onely of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but euen of Office: So alſo haue Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperours, called Ccuncels, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Controuerſies of Religion; aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced good Biſhops, repreſſed bad, and made Lawes concerning Biſhops, Miniſters, &amp; holy things for the welfare of the Church, and the glory of God: For the Magiſtrate is the Father of the Common-wealth; yea <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">Eſa. 49.23.</note> That <hi>Kings &amp; Queens are nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Fathers and Mothers of the Church: Conſtantine</hi> the Great, ſaid: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>the Biſhops were Ouer-ſeers in the Church, and Hee a Biſhop or Ouer-ſeer out of the Church.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:3294:161"/>
For the Duty, or Office, of the chiefe Magiſtrate, in the maintaining the ſecond Table, I néed not ſay any thing, for none is ſo ignorant, as not to know, that the procuring of the ciuill good of men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Supreme Gouernour.</p>
            <p>For the power of Magiſtrates, Sée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scriptures, in the Anſwere vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and for this they are called Gods, the Sonnes of the moſt High, not by Nature, but by Office and Dignity; being the Images of God, &amp; his Deputies Royall on earth: The Miniſters alſo of God, &amp;c. Whoſe Power it is better, and fitter, for Subiects to feare and obey, then to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute or determine.<note place="margin">Eccl. 8.3.4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the duties of Subiects: The firſt is, <hi>Reuerence,</hi> which is a godly ſubiection in Heart, Word, &amp; Déed: Thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and Iudging honourably of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, euen of the loweſt: Looking not to his perſon, whether good or bad, but the Perſon he repreſenteth which is GOD. Speaking reuerently,<note place="margin">Ex. 22.28. Act. 23.5. 1. Reg. 1.23.31.</note> Vſing all lowly Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures: Yea this requires, that Subiects interpret the ſayings and doings of the Magiſtrate to the beſt, and to conceale &amp; couer their faults, giuing feare to whom
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:3294:161"/>feare, &amp; honour to whom honor belongeth.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Duty is <hi>Obedience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 8.2.</note> to be performed by all perſons, and in all things poſſible (the contrary whereof God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth not) though hard and vnequall, not examining what it is which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but being content with this,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.21.</note> that it is commanded: And this obedience muſt be to all Gouernours, to the King as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, and to the reſt appointed by him,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.13.14.</note> and to theſe, whether Chriſtian or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, Good or Bad, Mercifull or Cruel, for there is no power but of God.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The third is <hi>Piety,</hi> that Subiects pray for their Gouernours: Yea,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.1. Ier. 29.7.</note> though they were Infidels, or Wicked: Thus did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> Thus did the Ancient Chriſtians for the Heathen Emperours, for their long life and ſafety, for their Iſſue &amp; Of-ſpring, for their quiet Gouernment; that their Councell might bée Wiſe and Faithfull, their Armes Victorious, their People Loyall, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The fourth is <hi>Faithfulneſſe,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that Subiects be quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and true-hearted in all Loyall Allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance: that they be not Trayterous or Seditious, raiſing, or conſenting to Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:3294:162"/>Inſurrections, Mutynies, &amp;c. but that they reueale ſuch things ſpéedily, and that what they can, by all good, poſſible, and lawfull meanes, they do defend and kéep ſafe, the Health, Life, Perſon, Cauſe, Crowne, Dignity, and Family of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrate, againſt all Oppoſites whatſoeuer;<note place="margin">2. Sam. 16.9. &amp; 20.22. &amp; 21.16.17 2. Reg. 11.2.4. 1. Ioh. 3.16.</note> yea, with the loſſe of their owne beſt bloud: For if we muſt lay downe our liues for our Brethren, much more for our Fathers.</p>
            <p>The fift is <hi>Thankfulnes,</hi> which is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and chéerfulloue, which is to be ſhewed in a willing paying of tribute, &amp; bearing ſuch charges as are impoſed by the King or ſuperior magiſtrate: in as much as the treaſure of the King is the ſinew of the common wealth, and becauſe he watcheth and careth for all,<note place="margin">Ro. 13.6.7.</note> and defends all: So <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> trauel willingly to be tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Yea our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 17.27.</note> and <hi>Peter</hi> pay tribute; none are exempt, for if <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> then why not their ſucceſſors? And all theſe things, Subiects are to doe chéerfully and willingly, euen to wicked princes; not only for feare, but for conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience toward God,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.18 Rom. 13.5.</note> who accounts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe neglected, reſiſted, and oppoſed, when
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:3294:162"/>his deputies are reſiſted, oppoſed,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 1.</hi> Firſt, it is the duety of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, wel to inſtruct, and to put their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in remembrance of theſe things, that they may know their duetie to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors, and performe allegeance accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, wherein is a great part of the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Common wealth.<note place="margin">Tit. 3.1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 2.</hi> Hence it appeareth that the Pope with his limbs are the great rebells of the world; for not onely pulling their neckes, as Eccleſiaſtical perſons from the yoake of the Emperour and their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes; but ſpecially for ſeeking to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule, depoſe, and deſtroy, the kings, and kingdomes of the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 3.</hi> Learne thy duty. Thy calling is to be ſubiect. Pray for the proſperity of the King, his children, and dominions: Speake not euill:<note place="margin">Iude 8.</note> but reuerence in word and déed the chiefe and all vnder-magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; yea, thinke not an euill thought:<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10.20, &amp;c.</note> Beware of Sedition, by the example of <hi>Corah, Abſolon, Sheba &amp;c.</hi> Obey for conſcience. Quarrell not, neither mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure at the commandement, though vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall &amp; hard, if not impious to be done:
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:3294:163"/>yea, if it be doubtfull, examine it not, but obey. Pay all ſubſidies, taxes, cuſtomes, &amp;c. willingly, yea though it goe hard with thée, and thine, and thou be faine to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it. Do it of conſcience, and thou ſhalt be the more bleſſed in thy ſubſtance. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Chriſt</hi> had it not when it was due, and he willingly paid: and ſurely, if wee muſt willingly pay to a Heathen, much more to a Chriſtian, religious, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and renowned king. Draw not thy neeke out of the yoake, and being able, go not about to be eaſed of that which is thy duty in conſcience to pay. It is no part of a good ſubiect, or of one that loueth his Prince or Common wealth, to ſéek to be frée, or to be eaſed oboue his Equalls, in a common burthen, the benefite whereof comes to himſelfe. It is a thing too much practiſed in theſe dayes, to the great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance and dammage of the Kings excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Maieſty, the Countrey, and many particular men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe 4.</hi> Praiſe God, for eſtabliſhing ſo worthy, religious, peaceable, learned, and famous a King ouer vs, through whom we enioy, peace, liberty, plenty, hope of ſucceſſion, and the ſwéete comfort of our
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:3294:163"/>Soules, the holy Goſpel.

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:3294:164"/>harueſt; &amp; all the Commons with peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, loyall, and religious minds, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: that God would hold backe the Iudgements we haue deſerued; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and increaſe vpon vs and our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity his vndeſerued mercies, bodily and ſpirituall, to his owne glory, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and eternall comfort of vs all, through our princely Sauiour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p>So be it.</p>
            <p>Now vnto the King euerlaſting, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, inuiſible, vnto God onely wiſe, be honour,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.17</note> and glory, for euer and euer, Amen.</p>
